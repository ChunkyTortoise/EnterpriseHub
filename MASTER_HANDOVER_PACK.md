### 🔑 Key Assets
- **Total Repos**: 11 (Tier 1: EnterpriseHub, docqa-engine, insight-engine, ai-orchestrator)
- **Technical Strength**: 8,340+ automated tests, 89% LLM cost reduction, P95 latency < 2s.
- **Certifications**: 19 professional certs (1,768+ learning hours) across AI, Data, BI, and Marketing.
- **Primary Market**: AI Chatbot/Agent Development, RAG Systems, and Automated BI.

2. **The RAG Pro (docqa-engine)**: Compliance-grade document intelligence. Target: $7,500.
3. **The BI Engine (insight-engine)**: Predictive analytics + marketing attribution. Target: $5,000 - $10,000.
4. **The MCP Specialist (mcp-toolkit)**: Custom server development for AI workflows.

## 🛠️ Deployment & Dev Instructions for Next Agent

### Repository Map
- `/Users/cave/Documents/GitHub/EnterpriseHub`: Flagship GHL/Real Estate AI.
- `/Users/cave/Documents/GitHub/docqa-engine`: High-accuracy RAG.
- `/Users/cave/Documents/GitHub/insight-engine`: BI & Analytics.
- `/Users/cave/Documents/GitHub/mcp-toolkit`: Emerging tech assets.
- `/Users/cave/Documents/GitHub/chunkytortoise.github.io`: Portfolio frontend.

### Immediate Next Steps (The "Beginning")
1. **EnterpriseHub**: Implement the `portfolio_landing.py` Streamlit component and update `README.md` with quantified metrics.
2. **MCP Toolkit**: Build the `calendar_sync.py` and `slack_notifier.py` servers to support the "Handoff" use case.
3. **Documentation**: Create the "ROI Breakdown" tables for all Tier 1 repos.

### How to Complete
- Each repo must have a green-light verification report (all tests passing).
- Each flagship must have an embedded video demo (script is ready in `EnterpriseHub/content/video/`).
- The portfolio site must link to the "Service Bundles" outlined in `SERVICE_BUNDLES.md`.
