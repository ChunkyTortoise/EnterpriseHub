Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well! I'm building out my LinkedIn profile as I grow my consulting practice and would really appreciate a recommendation from you.

Working together on [specific project] was a highlight for me, especially how we tackled [specific technical challenge]. Since then, I've been deep in AI engineering -- I built a multi-agent orchestration platform for real estate that manages a $50M+ pipeline with three specialized AI bots handling lead qualification, buyer assessment, and seller consultations.

If you have a few minutes, I'd love if you could speak to our collaboration, particularly around my work with Python and system architecture. Any insights about how we approached [specific problem] or my attention to testing and code quality would be incredibly helpful -- I now maintain 8,500+ automated tests across 11 production repositories, which I think reflects the engineering discipline you saw in our work together.

No pressure if you're swamped -- I know how it goes! Let me know if there's anything I can do to return the favor, including writing a recommendation for you.

Thanks,
Cayman
