Hi [Name],

I hope you've been well! As I'm building out my professional profile for consulting, I'd be grateful for a recommendation from you. Your mentorship around [specific area like "system design" or "production-grade Python"] has been formative in how I approach engineering problems, and I still reference [specific advice or project] regularly.

Since we last worked together, I've taken those lessons and run with them. I now maintain 11 production repositories with 8,500+ automated tests, 33 Architecture Decision Records, and published P50/P95/P99 benchmarks in every repo. The testing discipline and documentation rigor you instilled are a big part of why my systems run reliably -- my latest platform manages a $50M+ pipeline with sub-200ms orchestration overhead.

If you have time, I'd love if you could speak to my growth in Python engineering and system architecture, and how I approach technical challenges with a testing-first mindset. Your perspective on my progression would be especially meaningful to potential clients and collaborators.

No worries if you're too busy -- I know your time is valuable. Let me know if there's anything I can help you with!

Thanks,
Cayman

**Personalization notes**: Replace [Name], [specific area], and [specific advice or project]. This template works best with someone who knew you earlier in your career and can speak to growth. The 11 repos / 8,500 tests / 33 ADRs numbers demonstrate that the mentorship translated into measurable engineering maturity.
