# LinkedIn Recommendation Request -- Peer Developer

**Template**: 4 (Peer Developer)
**Personalized with**: Open source portfolio, specific collaboration examples

Hey [Name],

Hope you're crushing it! I'm working on my LinkedIn profile as I build out my AI consulting practice, and would love a recommendation from you if you're up for it.

We've collaborated on enough [code reviews/projects/open-source work] that I think you have a solid sense of how I work. Since then, I've been shipping a lot -- 11 production repos covering everything from multi-LLM orchestration to RAG pipelines to CRM integrations, all with 80%+ test coverage and Docker support.

If you're willing, I'd appreciate you touching on my Python and FastAPI skills, my approach to testing (I'm at 8,500+ tests now, which you probably find as obsessive as I do), or how we tackle technical problems together. Anything about the quality of code I ship or how I handle complex system design would be great for the consulting prospects who'll read it.

My GitHub portfolio is at github.com/ChunkyTortoise if you want to reference specific repos -- the ai-orchestrator and docqa-engine repos are probably the most impressive from an engineering standpoint.

Let me know if you need a recommendation too -- happy to write one for you!

Cheers,
Cayman
