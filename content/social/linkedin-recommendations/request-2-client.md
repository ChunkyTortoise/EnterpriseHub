## Message (Copy-Paste Ready)

Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out because I'm strengthening my LinkedIn presence as I grow my freelance AI engineering practice, and I'd be honored if you'd consider writing a recommendation.

Our work together on [project name] was a great experience. I'm especially proud of the results we achieved -- the 89% reduction in LLM costs through the 3-tier caching system, and the sub-200ms response times we hit consistently in production. Those numbers have become a cornerstone of how I pitch my work to new clients.

If you're willing, I'd appreciate you highlighting the business impact you saw -- whether that was faster response times, cost savings, better lead qualification, or improved data insights. Even a few sentences about the delivery process (testing rigor, documentation quality, communication) would carry real weight with the engineering managers and CTOs I'm trying to reach.

Happy to reciprocate or support you in any way. Thanks for considering it!

Best,
Cayman

## Personalization Notes

- Replace `[Name]` and `[project name]` with specifics
- The 89% cost reduction and <200ms latency are verified EnterpriseHub metrics
- If the client saw different impact (e.g., lead conversion, dashboard adoption), swap the metrics accordingly
- Emphasize whichever outcome they would remember most
