Hi [Name],

I hope you've been well! As I'm building out my professional profile for freelance AI engineering, I'd be grateful for a recommendation from you. Your mentorship around [system design / production Python / architecture decisions] has been formative in how I approach engineering problems.

Since we last worked together, I've built 11 production repositories with 8,500+ automated tests, deployed multi-agent AI systems managing a $50M+ real estate pipeline, and achieved benchmarks like 4.3M tool dispatches/sec and 89% LLM cost reduction. I reference your guidance on [specific advice] regularly -- it shaped how I think about building systems that actually hold up in production.

If you have time, I'd love if you could speak to my growth in AI systems engineering and how I approach technical challenges -- code architecture, testing discipline, that sort of thing. Your perspective on my progression would be especially meaningful given that you saw the earlier stages.

No worries if you're too busy -- I know your time is valuable. Let me know if there's anything I can help you with.

Thanks,
Cayman

## Personalization Notes

- Replace `[Name]` and bracketed areas with specifics
- The 11 repos, 8,500+ tests, $50M+ pipeline, and benchmarks are all real -- keep them
- Reference a specific piece of advice or project they'd remember
- This template works best for someone who knew you before the current portfolio existed
