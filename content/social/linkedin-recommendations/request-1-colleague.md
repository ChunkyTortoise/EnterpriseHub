Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well! I'm building out my LinkedIn profile as I take on more freelance AI engineering work, and a recommendation from you would mean a lot.

Working together on [project name] was a highlight -- especially how we tackled the multi-agent orchestration and handoff logic. The system we built ended up handling 4.3 million tool dispatches per second in benchmarks, which I'm still proud of.

If you have a few minutes, I'd love if you could speak to our collaboration, particularly around my work with Python, FastAPI, and the multi-agent architecture. Anything about how we approached testing (we wrote 8,500+ automated tests across the platform) or how I handled system design decisions would be incredibly helpful for establishing credibility with potential clients.

No pressure if you're swamped -- I know how it goes. Happy to write one for you too.

Thanks,
Cayman

## Personalization Notes

- Replace `[Name]` with the actual person's name
- Replace `[project name]` with the specific shared project
- The 4.3M dispatches/sec and 8,500+ tests are real portfolio metrics -- keep them
- If they worked on a different aspect, swap "multi-agent orchestration" for the relevant area (e.g., "RAG pipeline", "CRM integration", "caching layer")
