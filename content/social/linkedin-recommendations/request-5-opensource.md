## Message (Copy-Paste Ready)

Hi [Name],

I saw you've been using [docqa-engine / insight-engine / ai-orchestrator / scrape-and-serve] and wanted to reach out! I'm building my LinkedIn profile for freelance AI engineering and would really value a recommendation from someone who's actually used my work in practice.

The project has [322 automated tests / 640 tests / 550 tests] and I put a lot of effort into making the documentation, Docker setup, and API design production-ready rather than just demo-quality. If you found it useful, I'd appreciate a few words about the [RAG retrieval accuracy / dashboard visualizations / orchestration framework / API design] or any impact it had on your project.

Real-world feedback from practitioners carries a lot more weight than self-reported metrics, so even a couple of sentences about your experience would be incredibly helpful.

If there's anything I can do to improve the project or help with your use case, just let me know. Always happy to support people using the tools.

Best,
Cayman
