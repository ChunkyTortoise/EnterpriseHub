# LinkedIn Recommendation Request -- Open Source Community Member

**Template**: 5 (Open-Source Community Member)
**Personalized with**: Specific repo usage, DocQA/InsightEngine focus, community value

---

Hi [Name],

I saw you've been using [specific repo like "docqa-engine" or "insight-engine"] and wanted to reach out! I'm building my LinkedIn profile for my consulting practice and would really value a recommendation from someone in the community who's actually used my work.

A few things about the project that might help frame a recommendation:
- The repo has [550+/640+] automated tests with 80%+ coverage
- It includes Docker support, benchmark suites, and Architecture Decision Records
- It's part of a broader portfolio of 11 production repos with 8,500+ tests total
- The RAG/analytics architecture was extracted from a live system managing a $50M+ pipeline

If you found the [tool/library] useful, I'd appreciate a few words about the code quality, the API design, the documentation, or any impact it had on your project. Real-world feedback from practitioners like you carries a lot of weight with potential consulting clients.

If there's anything I can do to improve the project or help with your use case, just let me know. I actively maintain all my repos and prioritize community feedback.

Thanks for considering it!

Best,
Cayman

**Personalization notes**: Replace [Name] and [specific repo]. Check the repo's GitHub stars, issues, and forks to identify actual users. This template works best after a genuine interaction -- someone who filed an issue, opened a PR, or starred the repo. Don't send this cold to random users.

## Sending Strategy

| Template | Priority | Send Week | Batch Size |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 (Colleague) | High | Week 1 | 2 requests |
| 2 (Client) | High | Week 1 | 1 request |
| 3 (Mentor) | Medium | Week 2 | 1 request |
| 4 (Peer) | Medium | Week 2 | 1 request |
| 5 (Community) | Lower | Week 3+ | As organic relationships develop |

**Follow-up**: If no response after 7-10 days, send one gentle reminder. Do not follow up more than once.

**Goal**: 3-5 recommendations within 30 days, prioritizing Templates 1-2 for highest credibility impact.
