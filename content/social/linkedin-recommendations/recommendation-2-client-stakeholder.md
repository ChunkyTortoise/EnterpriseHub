# LinkedIn Recommendation Request -- Client/Stakeholder

**Template**: 2 (Client/Stakeholder)
**Personalized with**: Business impact metrics, CRM integration experience

Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out because I'm strengthening my LinkedIn presence as I expand my AI consulting practice, and I'd be honored if you'd consider writing a recommendation.

Our work together on [project name] was a great experience, and I'm proud of what we achieved -- especially [specific outcome]. That project taught me a lot about delivering business impact, not just code. Since then, I've doubled down on that approach: my current platform achieved an 89% reduction in LLM costs through intelligent caching and manages a $50M+ real estate pipeline with automated lead qualification across 10 dimensions.

If you're willing, I'd appreciate you highlighting the [AI system/automation pipeline/integration] we built and any impact you saw on [operational efficiency/customer experience/data insights]. Even a few sentences about the business outcomes or how I approached understanding your requirements would mean a lot to potential clients evaluating my work.

Happy to reciprocate or support you in any way. Thanks for considering it!

Best,
Cayman

**Personalization notes**: Replace [Name], [project name], and [specific outcome] for each recipient. The key ask is business impact language -- recommenders who are clients carry more weight when they mention measurable results. The 89% cost reduction and $50M+ pipeline give them proof points to reference.
