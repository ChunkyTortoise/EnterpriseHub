Hey [Name],

Hope you're crushing it! I'm building out my LinkedIn profile for freelance work and would love a recommendation from you if you're up for it.

We've collaborated on enough [code reviews / projects / technical discussions] that I think you have a solid sense of how I work. My portfolio now spans 11 production repos -- FastAPI backends, RAG document search engines, multi-agent chatbot platforms, Streamlit dashboards -- all with 80%+ test coverage and CI/CD pipelines. You've seen firsthand how I approach [testing / architecture / problem-solving / code review].

If you're willing, I'd appreciate you touching on my Python and FastAPI skills, my testing practices (TDD is non-negotiable for me), or how we collaborate on technical problems. Anything specific about a project we worked on together would carry extra weight.

Let me know if you want a recommendation too -- happy to write one for you. Just point me at what you'd like highlighted.

Cheers,
Cayman
