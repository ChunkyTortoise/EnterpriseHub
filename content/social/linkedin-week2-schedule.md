## Posting Schedule

| # | Date | Day | Time (PT) | Time (ET) | Topic | File |
|---|------|-----|-----------|-----------|-------|------|
| 1 | Feb 17 | Monday | 8:30 AM | 11:30 AM | Why I Test AI Systems Differently | `linkedin-week2-post-1.md` |
| 2 | Feb 19 | Wednesday | 9:00 AM | 12:00 PM | The Real Cost of "Just Use LangChain" | `linkedin-week2-post-2.md` |

### Why These Times

- **8:30-9:00 AM PT** = peak LinkedIn engagement window (professionals check feed before/during morning standup)
- **Mon/Wed/Fri** cadence avoids fatigue while maintaining visibility in the algorithm
- Tuesday and Thursday reserved for engagement-only activity (comments, connection requests)

## Pre-Post Checklist (Do Before Each Post)

- [ ] Copy post text from the corresponding file
- [ ] Paste into LinkedIn "Start a post" composer
- [ ] Verify hashtags are included at the bottom (5 per post)
- [ ] Add no image (text-only posts get higher organic reach on LinkedIn in 2026)
- [ ] Preview formatting -- ensure line breaks render correctly
- [ ] Hit "Post" (do NOT schedule via LinkedIn scheduler -- direct posting gets better distribution)

---

## Post-Publish Checklist (Do Within 1 Hour of Posting)

- [ ] Reply to the first 3 comments within 30 minutes (critical for algorithm boost)
- [ ] Add a follow-up comment on your own post with a question or additional insight
- [ ] Send the post link to 3-5 connections via DM with a personal note ("Thought of you when writing this")
- [ ] Like and comment on 5 posts from your feed (reciprocity drives engagement)

## Engagement Comment Templates

Use these as starting points -- always personalize:

**For technical posts**: "Great breakdown. We ran into the same issue with [X] and solved it by [Y]. What's your experience been with [Z]?"

**For opinion posts**: "Interesting take. I've seen this play out differently in [context] -- curious if you've considered [angle]?"

**For launch/announcement posts**: "Congrats on the launch. The [specific feature] stood out to me because [reason]. How did you approach [technical detail]?"

## Week 2 Success Metrics

Track these by end of day Friday (Feb 21):

| Metric | Week 1 Baseline | Week 2 Target |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Impressions per post | Record actual | +20% |
| Comments per post | Record actual | 5+ |
| New connections | Record actual | 30+ |
| Profile views | Record actual | +25% |
| DMs received | Record actual | 2+ |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Low impressions | Post is too short or lacks a hook. First 2 lines must stop the scroll. |
| No comments | Add a direct question at the end. Tag 1-2 relevant people. |
| Connection requests ignored | Personalize the note. Reference their recent post or shared interest. |
| Post formatting broken | LinkedIn strips some markdown. Use line breaks, not bullet points. Emoji sparingly. |
