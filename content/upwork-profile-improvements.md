# Upwork Profile Improvements — Cayman Roden

## Contract-to-Hire Preference
Open to converting contracts into full-time roles for the right team. I thrive in environments that value autonomy, production-quality engineering, and async-first communication.

## Working Style Assessment Answers

**Communication Style**: Async-first with daily written updates. I document progress, blockers, and decisions in writing so nothing gets lost. Available for video calls during overlap hours (PST) for critical discussions and weekly syncs.

**Work Hours**: Based in PST (UTC-8), flexible schedule. I maintain consistent daily output with 4-hour overlap available for US East Coast teams (9 AM - 1 PM EST). For European teams, I accommodate 2-hour overlap windows for critical meetings.

**Collaboration Preference**: Autonomous with clear requirements. Give me well-defined acceptance criteria and I'll own the deliverable end-to-end — from design to deployment. I default to over-communication: you'll always know what I'm working on, what's blocked, and what's shipping next.

**Problem-Solving Approach**: I identify blockers proactively and propose solutions before they become urgent. When requirements are ambiguous, I ask clarifying questions early rather than building the wrong thing.

## Profile Summary Refresh

**AI Engineer | LLM Orchestration | RAG Pipelines | Multi-Agent Systems | Production-Grade Python**

I build AI systems that ship to production — not prototypes that demo well and break under load.

Over the past year, I've built 11 open-source Python repositories with 7,016 automated tests, all maintaining green CI pipelines. Six have live Streamlit demos you can try right now. This isn't theoretical — it's proven, deployed, and tested.

**What I Build**

LLM Orchestration & Multi-Agent Systems: I design multi-agent architectures where specialized bots handle distinct workflows — lead qualification, buyer engagement, seller conversations — with intelligent handoff logic, circular prevention, and pattern learning from outcomes. My EnterpriseHub platform runs 4,937 tests and achieves <200ms orchestration overhead with 3-tier Redis caching.

RAG Pipelines & Document Intelligence: I build retrieval-augmented generation systems using hybrid BM25 + TF-IDF without heavy frameworks like LangChain. My DocQA Engine processes 1,000+ page documents in under 2 seconds with citation scoring and 94% accuracy. 322 automated tests ensure reliability.

Data Dashboards & Analytics: I create interactive analytics platforms with Streamlit — upload a CSV, get forecasting, clustering, anomaly detection, and model quality monitoring. No data engineering team required.

API Development & CRM Integration: I build FastAPI async backends with Pydantic validation, rate limiting, JWT auth, and integrations with GoHighLevel, HubSpot, and Salesforce using a unified CRM adapter protocol.

**Technical Stack**

Python 3.11+ | FastAPI | PostgreSQL | Redis | SQLAlchemy | Pydantic | Docker | GitHub Actions CI/CD | Claude/GPT/Gemini APIs | BM25/TF-IDF retrieval | Streamlit | scikit-learn | httpx | pytest (80%+ coverage)

**Key Metrics**
- 89% reduction in LLM API costs through intelligent caching and prompt optimization
- <200ms p95 latency for multi-agent orchestration workflows
- 7,016 automated tests across 11 production repositories
- 3 CRM platforms integrated with unified protocol (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce)
- 6 live Streamlit demos deployed and running

**What You Get When You Hire Me**

Every engagement includes production-ready code with comprehensive tests, security hardening, deployment automation, and documentation your team can maintain. I don't just write features — I ship complete solutions with error handling, monitoring, and knowledge transfer.

I work async-first with daily written updates. You'll always know what's shipping, what's blocked, and what's next.

**Available for**: Contract ($65-75/hr) | Fixed-price projects | Contract-to-hire
