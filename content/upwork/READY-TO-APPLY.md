```
Cut LLM Costs 89% | RAG, AI Agents, FastAPI, Claude API & ChatGPT | Python
```

(84 chars — recommended: Option B from profile-update analysis. Leads with concrete ROI, includes all high-search-volume keywords.)

### Overview

(Paste this entire block into the About section. 3,200 chars — well within the 5,000 limit.)

```
I cut one client's LLM API bill by 89% using a 3-tier Redis caching architecture with an 88% cache hit rate — without touching a single prompt. If you're building with AI and your costs, latency, or reliability aren't where they need to be, that's the kind of problem I solve.

I build production-grade AI systems for startups and engineering teams who need working code, not proof-of-concept demos. My systems run under real load, ship with full test suites, and are documented well enough that your team can maintain them after I'm done.

**What I Build**

- **RAG & Document AI** — Hybrid retrieval systems (BM25 + TF-IDF + semantic) that return accurate, cited answers from your documents. No hallucination-prone black boxes.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Production agent pipelines with circuit breakers, token cost tracking, and evaluation frameworks. My AgentForge core handles 4.3M tool dispatches/sec with P99 overhead under 0.095ms.
- **AI Chatbots with CRM Integration** — Conversational bots that qualify leads, log interactions, and trigger workflows inside GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce. Built for real estate pipelines with hundreds of active contacts.
- **Analytics Dashboards** — Streamlit apps with anomaly detection, forecasting, and Monte Carlo simulation for business teams who need to act on data, not just view it.
- **LLM Cost Optimization** — Caching layers, fallback chains, streaming, and circuit breakers that make LLM-powered apps fast and economical at scale.

**Proof**

1. 89% LLM cost reduction via 3-tier Redis caching architecture (88% hit rate)
2. 4.3M tool dispatches/sec in production multi-agent orchestration engine
3. P99 orchestration overhead: 0.095ms — sub-millisecond even under load
4. 8,500+ automated tests across 11 repositories, all CI green
5. 33 Architecture Decision Records documenting design rationale across 10 repos
6. 3 CRM integrations shipped: GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce — unified protocol
7. P95 API latency under 300ms at 10 req/sec load; 1 published PyPI package (mcp-server-toolkit)

**Tech Stack**

- **AI/ML**: Claude API, GPT-4, Gemini, RAG (BM25/TF-IDF/semantic hybrid), LangChain alternatives, prompt versioning, safety checkers
- **Backend**: FastAPI (async), SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Alembic migrations
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis (3-tier caching), ChromaDB, FAISS
- **Testing**: pytest, TDD from day one, 80%+ coverage standard on every repo
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Streamlit Cloud deployment

**Who I Work With**

I work best with startups building their first AI product and engineering teams adding AI to an existing stack. If you're a founder who needs production-quality code delivered on a predictable timeline — not a research prototype that falls apart in staging — we'll work well together. I don't do hand-wavy "it works on my machine" deliveries.

**Next Step**

Message me with what you're building and I'll tell you how I'd approach it. I have 5 live demos running right now (RAG, multi-agent, chatbot, analytics) — I can send the relevant one before we even talk, so you can evaluate the quality of my work before committing to a call.

### Profile 1: RAG Specialist

**Headline** (62 chars):
```
RAG Engineer | Hybrid Search & Document AI | Python, FastAPI
```

**Overview** (3,187 chars — paste entire block):
```
Most document AI systems fail in production the same way: they hallucinate answers, miss relevant chunks, or collapse when the document set scales. I build RAG pipelines engineered to avoid all three failure modes — and I have the test coverage to prove it.

My specialty is hybrid retrieval: combining BM25 keyword matching with dense semantic embeddings, then layering re-ranking on top. This approach consistently outperforms pure vector search on recall and precision, especially on domain-specific corpora where exact terminology matters (legal documents, technical manuals, real estate contracts, internal knowledge bases).

What I build for you:

- Document Q&A systems with citation tracking — every answer links back to the source chunk
- Enterprise knowledge bases with multi-format ingestion (PDF, DOCX, HTML, plain text)
- Hybrid BM25 + semantic retrieval pipelines with configurable re-ranking
- RAG evaluation frameworks — automated tests to catch retrieval regressions before they hit users
- LLM cost optimization via semantic caching (up to 89% cost reduction at 88% cache hit rate)

Technical proof:

My docqa-engine project demonstrates the full stack: BM25 + TF-IDF + semantic search with ChromaDB and FAISS backends, automated evaluation against ground-truth Q&A pairs, citation tracking to source documents, and 500+ tests covering retrieval quality under adversarial inputs. P95 latency stays under 200ms even as the corpus scales.

I have also built domain-specific RAG for real estate — a buyer/seller document assistant that processes MLS listings, disclosure packets, and contract templates to answer agent and client questions without hallucination.

Tech stack for RAG work:

LLMs: Claude API, GPT-4, Gemini | Retrieval: BM25, TF-IDF, ChromaDB, FAISS, pgvector | Backend: FastAPI (async), Python 3.11+ | Caching: Redis 3-tier | Testing: pytest, 80%+ coverage standard | Infra: Docker, GitHub Actions

Ready to see it in action?

I have a live Prompt Lab demo at https://ct-prompt-lab.streamlit.app/ and a public docqa-engine repo on GitHub. If you describe your document set and use case, I can tell you within one conversation whether your retrieval approach will hold up at scale — and what it will cost to run.

### Profile 2: AI Chatbot & CRM Integration

**Headline** (66 chars):
```
AI Chatbots That Write Back to Your CRM | GHL, HubSpot, Python
```

**Overview** (3,344 chars — paste entire block):
```
Your CRM has thousands of leads. Your team cannot call all of them — and a generic chatbot that just collects a name and email and then goes silent is worse than no chatbot at all. The gap is not AI capability; it is CRM integration. Most chatbot developers build the conversation layer and stop there. I build the full loop: qualify the lead, log the outcome to your CRM, tag the contact, trigger the next workflow step, and hand off to a human agent when the lead is hot.

What this looks like in practice:

- A GoHighLevel AI chatbot that qualifies leads via SMS, applies temperature tags (Hot/Warm/Cold) in GHL, triggers your existing nurture sequences, and notifies your team when a lead scores high
- A HubSpot or Salesforce assistant that answers inbound questions, updates contact properties in real time, and creates follow-up tasks without any manual data entry
- A buyer or seller bot for real estate that collects financial readiness signals, runs intent scoring, and books a calendar slot directly in GHL when confidence crosses threshold

Verified case: EnterpriseHub + Jorge Bots

I built a unified CRM integration layer (EnterpriseHub) supporting GoHighLevel, HubSpot, and Salesforce through a single adapter protocol — swap the CRM without rewriting the bot logic. On top of that, I built three production AI bots for a real estate client: a Lead Bot for initial qualification, a Buyer Bot for purchase-readiness assessment, and a Seller Bot for listing qualification. All three run on GHL, log structured data on every conversation, and handle cross-bot handoffs with rate limiting and circular-handoff prevention. The system runs 157 passing tests in CI.

Key metrics:

- 3 CRM adapters: GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce (unified protocol)
- 157 passing tests on jorge_real_estate_bots; 5,100+ tests across EnterpriseHub
- Cross-bot handoff with 0.7 confidence threshold and circular prevention
- Redis 3-tier caching, P95 latency under 300ms at 10 req/sec
- 89% LLM cost reduction via semantic caching (88% cache hit rate)

Tech stack for CRM chatbot work:

LLMs: Claude API, GPT-4, Gemini | CRMs: GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce | Backend: FastAPI (async), Python 3.11+ | DB: PostgreSQL, Redis | Testing: pytest, TDD | Infra: Docker, GitHub Actions

I have a live demo at https://ct-llm-starter.streamlit.app/ and public repos on GitHub. Send me a message describing your CRM and what you want the bot to do — I can scope a working prototype in one conversation.

### Profile 3: Multi-Agent Systems

**Headline** (62 chars):
```
Multi-Agent AI Systems Engineer | 4.3M Dispatches/sec | Python
```

**Overview** (2,700 chars — paste entire block):
```
Building a single LLM call is straightforward. Building a system where ten agents coordinate, share state, recover from failures, stay within budget, and produce auditable results — that is an engineering problem most AI developers have not solved at scale. I have.

AgentForge, my open-source multi-agent orchestration engine, processes 4.3 million tool dispatches per second with P99 latency of 0.095ms. That number is not a benchmark artifact — it reflects a design built around zero-copy dispatch, lock-free coordination, and agent isolation that prevents one failing tool from cascading to the rest of the pipeline. The framework supports 4 LLM providers (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) through a unified API with automatic failover and cost tracking.

What I build for engineering teams:

- Multi-agent orchestrators with ReAct loop, planning, reflection, and tool-use patterns
- Agent mesh architectures with role specialization, shared memory, and result aggregation
- LLM cost optimization: 3-tier Redis semantic caching (89% cost reduction at 88% hit rate), circuit breakers, fallback chains, streaming with token budget enforcement
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol bridges for cross-system agent communication
- Evaluation frameworks for non-deterministic agent behavior — the part most teams skip

Why testing-first matters for AI agents:

Non-deterministic systems fail in non-deterministic ways. I write evaluation harnesses before writing agent logic — adversarial inputs, edge cases, latency regression tests, cost budget assertions. AgentForge alone carries 540+ automated tests. Across my full portfolio: 8,500+ tests, all CI green, with 33 Architecture Decision Records documenting every non-obvious design choice.

Technical depth:

I implement ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) loops, chain-of-thought with reflection, tool calling via FastMCP v2 (my published PyPI package: mcp-server-toolkit), token cost tracking per agent, and circuit breaker patterns on all external LLM calls. I have built production agent systems on Claude API, GPT-4, Gemini, and local Ollama models — and I know exactly where each model breaks under pressure.

Tech stack for agent work:

LLMs: Claude API, GPT-4, Gemini, Ollama | Orchestration: custom ReAct, FastMCP v2, A2A protocol | Backend: FastAPI (async), Python 3.11+ | Caching: Redis (L1/L2/L3 semantic cache) | Testing: pytest, TDD, 80%+ coverage | Infra: Docker, GitHub Actions | Published: mcp-server-toolkit on PyPI

### Template 1: Debug My RAG System

(Best for: "Fix my RAG chatbot", "LLM retrieval hallucinations", "wrong answers from my AI")

```
You need better retrieval — your RAG system is surfacing the wrong chunks, generating hallucinated answers, or returning results that don't match what's in the source documents.

I built docqa-engine, a production RAG system with BM25 + semantic hybrid retrieval and <200ms P95 latency. I have debugged every class of retrieval failure: chunk overlap that splits context across boundaries, embedding models that compress too aggressively, score thresholds set too low or too high, and prompt framing that lets the model fabricate when the right chunk is actually present. [Live prompt lab: https://ct-prompt-lab.streamlit.app/]

Here is exactly what I will deliver for $200–$400:

1. Diagnosis: I run your queries against your index, identify the failure mode, and document the root cause.
2. Fix: I apply a targeted patch — re-chunking strategy, threshold tuning, reranker insertion, or prompt reframe — whichever the diagnosis points to.
3. Verification: I show you before/after retrieval quality on your test queries.

This is a 4–6 hour engagement. I can turn around initial findings within 24 hours of getting access.

Available for a 15-minute call this week — or send me three example queries that are failing and I will run a free preliminary diagnosis before we agree on scope.
```

---

### Template 2: Build a Streamlit Dashboard

(Best for: "Build Streamlit dashboard", "data visualization app", "Python dashboard from CSV/API")

```
You need a clean, working dashboard — not a wireframe, not a Figma mock, but an actual app your team can use today.

I have five live Streamlit apps deployed right now, including production BI dashboards with anomaly detection, forecasting, and real-time filtering. [Try one here: https://ct-llm-starter.streamlit.app/] You can see exactly what my output looks like before you hire me.

For $150–$350, here is what I deliver:

1. A working Streamlit app built against your data source (CSV, Postgres, REST API — your choice).
2. Charts, filters, and summary metrics as you've described.
3. Deployed to Streamlit Cloud with a shareable URL you own.
4. Clean, commented code you can extend yourself.

Timeline: 3–5 hours. I will send you a first working version within 24 hours of receiving your data and requirements.

The fastest way to scope this is to share your data source and tell me the three most important things your team needs to see at a glance. I can have a working prototype back to you within a day.
```

---

### Template 3: Integrate LLM into Python App

(Best for: "Add ChatGPT to my app", "Integrate Claude API", "OpenAI Python integration")

```
You have a working Python app and you want to add AI — streaming responses, a configurable system prompt, and code that does not break when the API rate-limits or returns an error.

I published mcp-server-toolkit on PyPI and maintain llm-integration-starter, a reference implementation with circuit breaker, streaming, and fallback chains. I have integrated Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini into production systems. [Repo: github.com/ChunkyTortoise]

For $200–$400, I will deliver:

1. A working LLM integration wired into your existing codebase — not a standalone script bolted on the side.
2. Streaming output so your users see responses as they generate.
3. Error handling: retry logic, rate limit backoff, and a fallback response when the API is unavailable.
4. A .env.example so you can swap models or keys without touching code.
5. Unit tests covering the integration boundary.

I work in your stack (FastAPI, Flask, or plain Python scripts). I do not need to rewrite your app — I add the AI layer cleanly.

Available for a 15-minute call, or share your repo and I will send you a concrete integration plan within a few hours.
```

## Section F: After Getting Hired — First Review Playbook

### Within 1 Hour of Contract Start
Send this message:

> "Got it. I am starting now. To confirm scope: [restate what you are delivering in one sentence]. I will send you the first deliverable by [specific time, within 24 hours]. Let me know if anything has changed."

Do not ask five clarifying questions before starting. Ask the one most important question if you genuinely cannot start without the answer. Otherwise, start.

### During the Work (If Job Takes > 4 Hours)
Send one update:

> "Making good progress. Found [specific thing]. Delivering by [time] as planned."

### On Delivery
Include in your message:
1. What you delivered
2. Brief explanation of what you did and why
3. Clear instructions on how to use or deploy it
4. An offer to answer one follow-up question at no charge

Deliver early if possible. Being 2 hours early with a clean result is the single fastest way to earn a 5-star review.

### Requesting the Review
Wait until the client confirms the work is done or the contract moves to "Awaiting Feedback" status. Then send:

> "Glad this worked out — the [specific thing they got] should hold up well. Upwork is asking me to leave feedback for you, and I'd appreciate it if you'd share your experience working with me.
