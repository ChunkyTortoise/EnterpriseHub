## Cover Letter

Python + Postgres + AI/ML pipelines on cloud infrastructure — that stack is exactly what I've been building in production for the past several years, and I can prove it with running code and test suites rather than just a resume.

My production platform (EnterpriseHub) is a FastAPI async backend with PostgreSQL, 3-tier Redis caching, and multi-agent AI orchestration built on Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini. The cache layer alone cut LLM costs by 89% and holds an 88% hit rate under sustained load. On the data pipeline side, I've built ETL workflows using pandas and scikit-learn that feed real-time analytics into Streamlit dashboards. The full repo has around 5,100 passing tests and runs CI green on every merge — which matters when you're working across product managers and timelines.

One thing I want to flag: I've built a lot of systems, but I've also had to explain them clearly to non-technical stakeholders and iterate fast when requirements shift. I write ADRs before I write code and over-document on purpose, because coming back to something six months later without context is a tax on the whole team.

I'm US-based in Palm Springs, native English, available now, and comfortable with less than 30 hours a week. $65/hr. What does the first sprint look like?

## Personalization Notes

**Hook choice**: Opens by mirroring the exact stack from the job post (Python, Postgres, AI/ML, cloud) without saying "I noticed your job posting." Signals the candidate read carefully.

**Proof points selected**:
1. **89% LLM cost reduction + 88% cache hit rate** — directly relevant to any team managing AI infrastructure costs, which is always a PM-level concern at this stage.
2. **5,100+ tests, CI green on every merge** — addresses the "iterate on deliverables" requirement without saying it explicitly. Shows the candidate ships reliably.
3. **ADRs + over-documentation** — directly speaks to PM collaboration and team communication requirement, which is listed explicitly in the job post.

**What was deliberately left out**:
- The 4.3M dispatches/sec metric (impressive but not directly relevant to a 30hr/week ongoing contract)
- The $50M pipeline stat (too domain-specific to real estate without context)
- Certifications (none)
- Bullet lists (per guidelines, prose only)

**Rate rationale**: $65/hr is mid-range within their $50-$90 band. Reflects 20+ years of experience without pricing out of a "less than 30hrs/week" engagement where they may be cost-sensitive.

**CTA**: "What does the first sprint look like?" — opens a conversation, signals project orientation, and avoids the "quick call" anti-pattern. Forces them to describe the work if they respond.

**Word count**: ~185 words (under 200 limit).

## A/B Variant: Subject Line (if Upwork allows custom subject)

**Primary**: `Python + Postgres + AI/ML — 20 years, 5,100 tests, CI green`
**Variant A**: `FastAPI/Postgres/LLM pipeline engineer — US, available now`
**Variant B**: `89% LLM cost cut, 5K+ tests — let's talk data pipelines`

Primary is most specific and mirrors the job title language. Variant B leads with the metric and may outperform if the hiring manager is cost-aware (common for 3-6 month ongoing contracts).

## Suggested Timing

Submit within 2 hours of reading this. The job is 2 hours old, has 20-50 proposals already, and the client viewed the listing 15 minutes ago — they are actively screening. Every hour of delay means more proposals ahead of Cayman's in the queue.
