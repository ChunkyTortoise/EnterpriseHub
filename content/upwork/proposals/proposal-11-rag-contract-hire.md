Cover Letter:

A 3-6 month RAG engagement means you need someone who can optimize retrieval quality, reduce hallucinations, and scale the system without blowing your API budget. I've tackled all three across my portfolio.

docqa-engine (500+ tests) is a hybrid RAG pipeline with BM25 + dense embeddings + reciprocal rank fusion. It has 94 automated retrieval quality tests measuring precision@k, recall@k, and MRR at every pipeline stage. The system includes cross-encoder re-ranking, query expansion, and multi-hop reasoning for complex document graphs. I measure what's working because gut feelings don't scale.

EnterpriseHub (around 5,100 tests) runs production RAG for real estate lead qualification. The platform processes natural language queries like "3-bedroom house near good schools under $800K" and retrieves relevant listings, market data, and neighborhood analytics. The caching layer alone cuts LLM API costs by 89% with an 88% hit rate — most of the savings come from recognizing that similar queries don't need fresh API calls every time.

For a long-term engagement I'd focus on retrieval quality optimization with hybrid search strategies tuned to your specific corpus, cost engineering with intelligent caching and embedding reuse, production reliability with latency tracking and health monitoring, and continuous improvement through A/B testing retrieval strategies and automated regression testing on every release.

I'm available under 30 hours/week and work in weekly sprint cycles with concrete deliverables. All my repos are Docker-ready with CI/CD pipelines, so you get production-quality code from day one. Let's chat about your use case.
