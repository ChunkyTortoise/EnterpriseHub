I noticed you're looking for backend Python support with strong TDD and API experience — this maps perfectly to my production workflow. I've built and maintained several FastAPI systems under test-first constraints, including a real estate AI platform with 5,100+ passing tests and sub-200ms API response times.

**Directly relevant experience:**

• **TDD-first development**: All 11 of my portfolio repos follow red-green-refactor discipline. EnterpriseHub has 98% test coverage across 5,100+ tests, with CI enforcing test passage before merge.

• **Production API support**: Built FastAPI orchestration layer handling 4.3M tool dispatches/second with 88% cache hit rate and 89% cost reduction via intelligent caching strategies.

• **Debugging & optimization**: Reduced LLM API overhead from 800ms to <200ms through L1/L2/L3 cache architecture and async request batching.

I work in tight feedback loops — write tests, fix issues, verify, ship. My repos are CI-green with Docker Compose configs ready for staging/prod environments. You can review live deployments at ct-enterprise-ai.streamlit.app and ct-document-engine.streamlit.app, plus all source code at github.com/chunkytortoise.

**Next step**: I'm available to start this week. Would a 30-minute call work to review your current API architecture and priority support areas? I can also provide a technical assessment of your test coverage gaps if helpful.

Looking forward to contributing to your backend reliability.
