## Overview (5,000 chars max)

I build production AI systems — not prototypes, not tutorials, not proof-of-concepts. Every project I deliver ships with automated tests, CI/CD pipelines, Docker support, and documented architecture decisions.

**What I specialize in:**

RAG Systems & Document Intelligence
I built docqa-engine, a hybrid retrieval pipeline (BM25 + dense embeddings with reciprocal rank fusion) designed for precision-critical document Q&A. It handles PDF, Word, and plain text ingestion with 500+ automated tests covering retrieval quality, cost tracking, and edge cases. When your search needs to return the *correct* answer — not just a *similar* one — that's where I work.

Multi-Agent AI Orchestration
My AgentForge framework (550+ tests) provides a unified async interface across Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and local models. Built-in features include multi-strategy response parsing, confidence-gated routing, and a 3-tier caching layer that reduced LLM costs by 89% in production. The system handles 4.3M tool dispatches per second with P99 latency under 0.1ms.

Full-Stack AI Platforms
EnterpriseHub is my flagship project — a real estate AI platform with ~5,100 tests, 3 specialized chatbots with cross-bot handoff, CRM integration (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce), Streamlit BI dashboards, and production monitoring with P50/P95/P99 latency tracking. It demonstrates everything I deliver: clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and business-measurable results.

**By the numbers:**
- 11 production repositories with 8,500+ automated tests
- 89% LLM cost reduction via intelligent caching (88% hit rate, verified)
- 33 Architecture Decision Records documenting engineering tradeoffs
- P50/P95/P99 benchmark suites in every repository
- Docker + GitHub Actions CI across all projects
- 20+ years of software engineering experience

**Tech stack:**
Python (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic), PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Claude/GPT-4/Gemini APIs, FAISS, BM25, sentence-transformers, Streamlit, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Alembic, pytest, httpx

**How I work:**
Remote-first, async communication, daily commits, over-documented. I write Architecture Decision Records so you understand *why* decisions were made, not just what code was written. Every deliverable includes tests, Docker support, and deployment documentation.

## Specialized Profiles

### Profile 1: RAG & Document Intelligence Engineer

**Title**: RAG Systems Engineer | Hybrid Retrieval, Document Q&A, Production Pipelines

**Description**: I build retrieval-augmented generation systems that prioritize precision over similarity. My approach combines BM25 keyword search with dense embeddings via reciprocal rank fusion, cross-encoder reranking, and confidence-gated LLM calls. Built and shipped docqa-engine (500+ tests) handling PDF/Word/text ingestion with automated quality measurement (precision@k, recall@k, MRR).

### Profile 2: AI/ML Platform Engineer

**Title**: AI Platform Engineer | Multi-Agent Systems, LLM Orchestration, FastAPI

**Description**: I architect modular AI platforms with clean service boundaries. My production systems include multi-provider LLM orchestration (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini), 3-tier Redis caching for cost reduction, cross-bot handoff with confidence scoring, and CRM integrations. EnterpriseHub (~5,100 tests) demonstrates the full stack: FastAPI async backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, Streamlit dashboards, and Docker deployment.

### Profile 3: Python Backend & Data Engineering

**Title**: Senior Python Engineer | FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Data Pipelines

**Description**: I build backend systems that handle production load with observable performance. My stack centers on async FastAPI with SQLAlchemy/Pydantic, PostgreSQL with Alembic migrations, Redis caching, and comprehensive pytest suites. Every service ships with P50/P95/P99 latency benchmarks, Docker support, and CI/CD pipelines.
