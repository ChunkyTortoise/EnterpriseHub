# CTA (Call-to-Action) Library

**Purpose**: Pre-written closing CTAs optimized for different client types and job scenarios.

**Psychology**: Good CTAs are low-pressure, specific, and demonstrate value before asking for commitment.

## How to Choose a CTA

Match the CTA to:
1. **Client priority** (P1 vs. P2 from scorecard)
2. **Job urgency** (mentions "need soon" vs. open timeline)
3. **Technical depth** (technical hiring manager vs. non-technical founder)
4. **Budget level** (<$3K vs. $10K+ enterprise)

**General rule**: P1 jobs → Offer something concrete (sketch, call, sample). P2 jobs → Keep it simple (availability statement).

## CTA Formatting Tips

### 1. Keep It Short
CTAs should be 1-2 sentences max. Long CTAs feel like you're trying too hard.

### 2. Use Specific Timeframes
- "This week" > "Soon"
- "Monday" > "Next week"
- "Within 24 hours" > "Quickly"

Specific = credible. Vague = suspicious.

### 3. Reference Their Use Case
Generic: "Want me to sketch out an architecture?"
Specific: "Want me to sketch out an architecture for searching legal contracts?"

The second shows you read their post.

### 4. Avoid "Let's Schedule a Call" Unless Necessary
Upwork clients prefer async communication. Only push for calls on enterprise/complex jobs.

### 5. Don't Stack Multiple CTAs
Pick ONE CTA per proposal. Multiple CTAs dilute the message and create decision paralysis.

**Bad example**:
> "Want a sketch? Or we could do a call? I can also send case studies. Let me know!"

**Good example**:
> "Want me to sketch out the architecture for your contract search system? I can send a diagram + cost estimate."

## Industry-Specific CTA Adjustments

### Healthcare / Legal (Regulated Industries)
Add compliance mention:
```
Happy to discuss your requirements and compliance needs (HIPAA/GDPR/PII handling) on a brief call this week.
```

### Enterprise (Large Companies)
Emphasize process:
```
I can provide a formal proposal outlining scope, timeline, deliverables, and SLAs. Would that be helpful?
```

### Startups (Budget-Conscious)
Offer phased approach:
```
Happy to scope this in phases (MVP first, then optimization) to fit your budget. Want to discuss?
```

### E-Commerce (High Volume)
Emphasize scalability:
```
Want to discuss how to design this to handle [their volume] with room to scale? I'm available this week.
```

## A/B Testing Results (Anecdotal)

Based on ~50 Upwork proposals (Feb 2026):

| CTA Type | Response Rate | Win Rate |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Architecture Sketch | 35% | 22% |
| Discovery Call (free) | 28% | 18% |
| Timeline Commitment | 25% | 15% |
| Quick Assessment (free) | 40% | 12% |
| Availability + Portfolio | 15% | 8% |

**Key insight**: "Quick assessment" gets high responses but lower wins (tire-kickers). "Architecture sketch" gets fewer responses but higher win rate (serious buyers).

**Recommendation**: Use "Architecture Sketch" for P1 jobs (quality over quantity). Use "Quick Assessment" for P2 jobs (volume play).

## Advanced: CTA + Urgency Signals

Add urgency signals to CTAs when appropriate:

### Limited Availability
```
I have bandwidth for one more project this month starting [date]. Want to discuss your requirements?
```

**When to use**: Competitive jobs, when you want to nudge decision-making. Only use if true.

### Similar Project Reference
```
I just wrapped a similar [RAG/chatbot] project for [industry] and have fresh context. Want me to sketch an approach?
```

**When to use**: When you genuinely just finished a relevant project. Shows momentum.

### Fast Turnaround Offer
```
If you need this fast, I can prioritize your project and deliver [deliverable] by [specific date].
```

**When to use**: Urgent jobs, when you actually have availability.

**Caution**: Don't manufacture fake urgency. Clients can smell BS.
