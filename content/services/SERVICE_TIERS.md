# Service Tiers

**Cayman Roden** | Python/AI Engineer | RAG Pipelines | Multi-LLM Orchestration | Production Systems

---

## Tier 1: Architecture Audit

**Investment**: $2,500 - $5,000
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Engagement**: Fixed-price project

### What You Get

A comprehensive assessment of your AI systems across six weighted categories -- Agentic AI Readiness, RAG Compliance, Latency Benchmarks, Data Quality, CRM Integration, and Security -- with a scored rubric, gap analysis, and prioritized migration roadmap.

### Deliverables

1. **Scored Assessment Report** (20-30 pages) -- Each category scored 1-5 with evidence, benchmarks, and specific findings.
2. **Gap Analysis** -- Critical gaps, improvement opportunities, and existing strengths mapped to business risk and ROI.
3. **Migration Roadmap** -- Phased action plan with estimated hours, priority levels, and cost projections for each improvement.
4. **Performance Benchmark Report** -- P50/P95/P99 latency measurements for your AI endpoints under representative load.
5. **LLM Cost Analysis** -- Current spend breakdown with projected savings from caching, model routing, and prompt optimization.
6. **60-Minute Walkthrough Call** -- Live review of findings, Q&A, and strategic recommendations.

### Scope

- Full codebase review of AI/ML pipeline architecture
- Infrastructure analysis (deployment, CI/CD, monitoring)
- Performance benchmarking under representative load
- Security and compliance review
- Stakeholder interview (1-2 sessions)

### Ideal Client

- Teams with existing AI systems that need optimization before scaling
- Companies evaluating their AI architecture before a major investment
- CTOs preparing for due diligence or compliance audits
- Organizations spending more than $1,000/month on LLM API costs

### Why This Matters

Most AI teams are leaving 40-80% of their LLM budget on the table. A 3-tier caching strategy alone typically reduces costs by 60-89%. The audit identifies exactly where that money is going and provides a concrete plan to recapture it.

**ROI**: The audit typically identifies $5,000-$15,000/month in savings opportunities. The engagement pays for itself within the first month of implementing Phase 1 recommendations.

## Tier 2: GHL + RAG Integration Build

**Investment**: $10,000 - $25,000
**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks
**Engagement**: Fixed-price project with milestone payments

### What You Get

A production-grade AI system integrating GoHighLevel CRM (or HubSpot/Salesforce) with a custom RAG pipeline, multi-LLM orchestration, and intelligent automation. This is not a prototype -- it ships with 80%+ test coverage, Docker deployment, CI/CD, and benchmark documentation.

### Deliverables

1. **Custom RAG Pipeline** -- BM25 + semantic search + re-ranking with hybrid score fusion. Tuned for your document corpus.
2. **Multi-LLM Orchestration** -- Claude, GPT-4, and/or Gemini with automatic fallback chains and cost-optimized routing.
3. **3-Tier Caching Layer** -- L1 in-memory, L2 Redis, L3 semantic similarity. Targets 70%+ cache hit rate.
4. **CRM Integration** -- Bidirectional sync with your CRM. AI-powered lead scoring, tag management, and workflow triggers.
5. **AI Chatbot(s)** -- Specialized bot(s) with intent detection, handoff orchestration, and context preservation.
6. **FastAPI REST API** -- Async endpoints with JWT auth, rate limiting, metering, and structured error responses.
7. **Streamlit Dashboard** -- BI analytics with key metrics, performance tracking, and cost monitoring.
8. **Test Suite** -- 80%+ coverage with pytest. Unit, integration, and edge-case tests.
9. **Docker Deployment** -- Dockerfile + docker-compose for development, staging, and production.
10. **CI/CD Pipeline** -- GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment.
11. **Architecture Documentation** -- ADRs, Mermaid diagrams, API documentation, and benchmark results.
12. **Knowledge Transfer** -- 90-minute session covering architecture decisions, maintenance procedures, and extension patterns.
13. **4-Week Post-Delivery Support** -- Bug fixes, configuration adjustments, and production stabilization.

### Milestone Schedule

| Milestone | Deliverables | Timeline | Payment |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Kickoff | Architecture design, ADRs, API spec | Week 1 | 30% upfront |
| Core Build | RAG pipeline, LLM orchestration, caching | Weeks 2-3 | 30% at milestone |
| Integration | CRM sync, chatbot, dashboard | Weeks 4-6 | 20% at milestone |
| Hardening | Tests, CI/CD, documentation, deployment | Weeks 7-8 | 20% at delivery |

### Ideal Client

- Real estate firms, agencies, and sales teams adding AI to their CRM workflows
- Companies launching AI-powered search, document Q&A, or knowledge bases
- Teams that tried LangChain or no-code AI tools and hit production limitations
- Organizations needing GoHighLevel integration with intelligent automation

### Why This Matters

The difference between an AI prototype and a production system is 10x the effort. Most teams underestimate the infrastructure needed for caching, error handling, monitoring, and testing. This engagement delivers a complete, production-hardened system -- not a demo that breaks under real load.

**Proof**: EnterpriseHub, built with this exact architecture, manages a $50M+ real estate pipeline with 89% LLM cost reduction, sub-200ms orchestration, and 5,100+ automated tests.

## Tier 3: Fractional AI CTO Retainer

**Investment**: $8,000 - $15,000/month
**Timeline**: Ongoing (minimum 3-month commitment)
**Engagement**: Monthly retainer

### What You Get

Dedicated AI architecture leadership for your organization. Architecture ownership, feature development, performance optimization, and strategic technical guidance -- without the $250K+ cost of a full-time AI engineering hire.

### Monthly Deliverables

1. **Architecture Ownership** -- Ongoing responsibility for AI system design, technology decisions, and technical debt management.
2. **Feature Development** -- New capabilities, integrations, and optimizations delivered each sprint.
3. **Performance Report** -- Monthly report with P50/P95/P99 latency trends, cache hit rates, LLM cost tracking, and SLA compliance.
4. **Code Reviews** -- Review of all AI-related pull requests for quality, security, and architecture alignment.
5. **Team Mentoring** -- Guidance for junior developers working on AI features. Pair programming sessions as needed.
6. **Strategic Roadmap** -- Quarterly technology roadmap aligned with business objectives.
7. **Incident Response** -- Priority response for production issues affecting AI systems.

### Tier Options

| Tier | Monthly Rate | Hours/Month | Includes |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|

| **Growth** | $12,000/mo | ~80 hrs | Feature development, optimization, weekly syncs |
| **Dedicated** | $15,000/mo | ~100+ hrs | Near full-time, architecture ownership, daily availability |

### Terms

- **Response time**: Priority Slack/email response within 4 hours during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM PT).
- **Communication**: Weekly sync calls (Growth/Dedicated), async daily updates, monthly strategy review.
- **Hour rollover**: Up to 10 unused hours roll over to the next month.
- **Cancellation**: 30-day written notice.
- **Billing**: Monthly in advance, net-15.

### Ideal Client

- Startups with AI products that need senior engineering leadership but cannot justify a $250K+ hire
- Companies scaling AI systems that need architecture guidance beyond what their current team provides
- Organizations managing complex AI infrastructure (multi-model, multi-CRM, real-time pipelines)
- Teams preparing for enterprise sales, compliance audits, or significant funding rounds

### Why This Matters

Hiring a full-time senior AI engineer costs $200-300K/year in salary alone, plus 3-6 months of recruiting time. A fractional engagement gives you the same caliber of technical leadership at 30-50% of the cost, with no recruiting overhead and no long-term commitment.

**What you get vs. a full-time hire**:

| Factor | Full-Time Hire | Fractional CTO |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Annual cost | $200-300K+ | $96-180K |
| Time to start | 3-6 months | 1 week |
| Commitment | 12+ months typical | 3-month minimum |
| Breadth of experience | 1-2 companies | 11 production repos, 3 CRM integrations, 20+ years |
| Production infrastructure | Builds from scratch | Proven patterns from day one |
