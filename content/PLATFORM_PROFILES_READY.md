Every system I deliver includes comprehensive test suites (8,500+ tests across my portfolio), CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers for reproducible deployments, and performance benchmarks measuring P50/P95/P99 latency under load.

**Fortune 500-Ready Engineering:**

My code ships with:
- 33 Architecture Decision Records documenting technical tradeoffs
- Benchmark suites validating SLA compliance
- Security compliance (JWT auth, Fernet encryption, PII protection)
- Monitoring and alerting (Prometheus-compatible metrics)
- Complete documentation (API specs, deployment guides, runbooks)

**Proven Impact:**
- 89% LLM cost reduction via intelligent caching strategies
- 4.3M tool dispatches/second in multi-agent orchestration
- <200ms orchestration overhead for real-time workflows
- 88% cache hit rates reducing API spend by 6 figures annually

**Technical Depth:**

I specialize in async Python (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, asyncio), PostgreSQL database design, Redis caching architectures, and AI integration (Claude, GPT, Gemini APIs). I've built CRM integrations for GoHighLevel, HubSpot, and Salesforce with OAuth 2.0 and rate-limit handling.

My systems include Streamlit BI dashboards with ML-powered forecasting, anomaly detection, and SHAP model explainability.

**Commitment to Quality:**

Twenty years of software engineering. I don't ship prototypes. I ship systems with tests, docs, CI/CD, and benchmarks. My GitHub portfolio (11 repos, all green CI) speaks for itself.
