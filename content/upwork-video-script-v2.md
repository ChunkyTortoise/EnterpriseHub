# Upwork Video Intro Script v2.0 — 60-90 Seconds

**Target Duration**: 75 seconds | **Word Count**: ~188 words | **Pace**: 2.5 words/second | **Created**: 2026-02-14

## [0-5s] Opening Hook

**SCRIPT**: "If you need an AI system that actually works in production — not a prototype that breaks under load — you're in the right place."

**DELIVERY**:
- Pause after "production" (0.5 sec)
- Emphasis on "actually works" and "breaks under load"
- Direct eye contact, confident tone

**B-ROLL**: GitHub Actions CI dashboard showing all green checkmarks

## [5-20s] Problem I Solve

**SCRIPT**: "I'm Cayman, and I solve a very specific problem: companies waste 3 to 6 months building AI systems that look impressive in demos but can't handle real users, real data, or real-world edge cases. They end up rebuilding from scratch — which is where I come in."

**DELIVERY**:
- Pause after "I'm Cayman" (0.3 sec)
- Slower pace on "3 to 6 months" (emphasize waste)
- Speed up slightly on "real users, real data, real-world edge cases" (rhythm)
- Pause before "which is where I come in" (0.5 sec)

**B-ROLL**: Split-screen: failing test suite on left, green CI pipeline on right

## [20-45s] Proof Points

**SCRIPT**: "I've built 11 open-source repositories with over 8,500 automated tests — every single one has a green CI pipeline. Five of them have live Streamlit demos you can try right now, no signup required. My flagship real estate AI platform reduced LLM costs by 89 percent through intelligent caching and handles multi-agent orchestration with under 200 milliseconds latency. This isn't vaporware — it's deployed, tested, and managing a 50 million dollar sales pipeline."

**DELIVERY**:
- Pause after "8,500 automated tests" (0.3 sec)
- Emphasis on "every single one" (credibility signal)
- Slower on "89 percent" and "200 milliseconds" (let metrics land)
- Pause after "vaporware" (0.5 sec)
- Strong emphasis on "50 million dollar" (business impact)

**B-ROLL**:
- GitHub repo grid showing all 11 repos with test badges
- Streamlit demo montage (3-second clips of each app)
- EnterpriseHub dashboard showing cache hit rate graph
- Performance benchmark chart (P50/P95/P99 latency)

## [45-65s] What I Build

**SCRIPT**: "Here's what I actually build: RAG systems for document intelligence — process 1,000-page PDFs in under 2 seconds with citation scoring. Multi-agent orchestration — Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini working together with intelligent handoff logic. Data dashboards — upload a CSV, get forecasting, clustering, and anomaly detection without writing a line of code. And CRM integrations — GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce, all with a unified protocol."

**DELIVERY**:
- Clear enunciation on technical terms (RAG, Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
- Pause after each capability (0.3 sec): "2 seconds", "handoff logic", "line of code", "unified protocol"
- Slightly faster pace to fit content

**B-ROLL**:
- DocQA demo: PDF upload → instant answers with citations
- AgentForge mermaid diagram (multi-agent mesh)
- Insight Engine dashboard with interactive charts
- CRM adapter architecture diagram

## [65-75s] Call to Action

**SCRIPT**: "If you're building AI products and need an engineer who ships production-grade work — not just prototypes — let's talk. I'm available for contract work at 85 to 100 dollars an hour. Send me a message and let's discuss your project."

**DELIVERY**:
- Pause after "production-grade work" (0.5 sec)
- Clear enunciation on rate: "85 to 100 dollars an hour"
- Warmer tone on final sentence (inviting, not pushy)
- End with slight smile

**B-ROLL**: Upwork profile screenshot with "Message Cayman" button highlighted

## Production Checklist

### Recording Setup
- [ ] **Lighting**: Natural light from window or ring light (avoid harsh shadows)
- [ ] **Background**: Clean, uncluttered (bookshelf or plain wall ideal)
- [ ] **Camera**: Eye-level or slightly above (never below)
- [ ] **Orientation**: Landscape (1920x1080 minimum resolution)
- [ ] **Audio**: External mic or quiet room with no echo
- [ ] **Outfit**: Business casual (solid colors, avoid stripes/patterns)

### Delivery Tips
- [ ] Look at camera lens, not screen (tape small dot above lens as guide)
- [ ] Speak naturally, not robotically (read script 10x before recording)
- [ ] Smile at beginning and end (warmth builds trust)
- [ ] Use hand gestures sparingly (keeps energy, avoid distraction)
- [ ] Record 3-5 takes, pick best performance

### Editing Workflow
1. **Trim**: Cut dead air at start/end, remove long pauses (>1 sec)
2. **Color Correct**: Adjust brightness/contrast for professional look
3. **Audio**: Normalize levels, remove background noise
4. **B-Roll**: Overlay screen recordings during proof points section (20-45s)
5. **Captions**: Add subtitles for accessibility (60% watch without sound)
6. **Export**: 1920x1080, H.264 codec, under 50MB for fast Upwork upload

### B-Roll Recording Checklist

**Before Recording**:
1. Close all browser tabs except demos
2. Clear browser history/cookies (fresh session)
3. Set browser zoom to 100%
4. Hide bookmarks bar
5. Use incognito mode to avoid autofill

**Screen Recordings Needed** (use QuickTime Player or OBS):

| Clip | Duration | Actions |
|------|----------|---------|
| GitHub dashboard | 3s | Scroll through repo list, show test badges |
| EnterpriseHub demo | 5s | Dashboard view → chatbot interaction |
| DocQA demo | 4s | Upload PDF → ask question → show answer with citations |
| AgentForge diagram | 3s | Pan across mermaid architecture diagram |
| Insight Engine | 4s | Upload CSV → show forecasting chart |
| Benchmark results | 3s | Scroll through BENCHMARKS.md P50/P95/P99 table |

**Recording Settings**:
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Frame rate: 30fps
- Format: MP4 (H.264)
- Cursor: Show cursor for interactions, hide for static views

## A/B Testing Plan (Future Iteration)

Create 2 versions to test conversion rates:

**Version A** (Technical Emphasis):
- Lead with metrics: "8,500 tests, 89% cost reduction"
- Focus on architecture: "Multi-agent mesh, 3-tier caching"
- CTA: "If you value engineering rigor..."

**Version B** (Business Emphasis):
- Lead with impact: "$50M pipeline, 89% cost savings"
- Focus on outcomes: "Deploy same day, no rebuilds"
- CTA: "If you need results, not promises..."

**Test Metrics**:
- Profile views from video vs text-only
- Proposal acceptance rate (video viewers vs non-viewers)
- Hourly rate objections (track client pushback)

## Thumbnail Strategy

Upwork video thumbnails auto-generate from first frame. Optimize by:

1. **First 3 seconds**: Show face clearly (builds trust)
2. **Text overlay** (optional): "8,500 Tests | 89% Cost Reduction"
3. **Avoid**: Dark frames, blurry motion, text-heavy screens
4. **Test**: Record 3 versions with different opening frames, pick best thumbnail

**Version**: 2.0 | **Status**: Production-ready | **Next Review**: After 50 profile views
