## 2. Profile Setup

### Headline
**AI Engineer | RAG Systems, Multi-Agent Chatbots & BI Dashboards | Python + FastAPI**

### Bio
I build production AI systems that reduce costs, qualify leads, and turn raw data into actionable insights. My specialty is enterprise-grade Python applications: RAG document search, multi-agent chatbot orchestration, and interactive BI dashboards.

Every project ships with automated tests (8,500+ across my portfolio), Docker deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and full documentation. I do not deliver prototypes -- I deliver systems you can run in production on day one.

What sets me apart:
- 89% LLM cost reduction via 3-tier Redis caching (verified benchmarks)
- 94% retrieval precision in RAG systems (RAGAS evaluated)
- 4,937 automated tests on my chatbot platform alone
- 20+ years software engineering, remote-first with daily commits

I work best with teams that need AI integrated into their existing stack -- CRM sync, API endpoints, analytics dashboards, and human escalation workflows included.

### Skills
Python, FastAPI, AI/ML, RAG Systems, LLM Integration, Chatbot Development, Data Visualization, Streamlit, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, GitHub Actions
