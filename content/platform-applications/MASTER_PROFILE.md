## Universal Bio (100 Words)

AI/ML engineer with 20+ years of software experience specializing in production-grade GenAI systems, RAG pipelines, and multi-agent architectures. I build systems that ship -- not prototypes. My portfolio includes 11 repos with 8,500+ automated tests, 89% LLM cost reduction via 3-tier Redis caching, and 4.3M tool dispatches/sec in my AgentForge engine. I've built real estate AI platforms managing $50M+ pipelines with Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini orchestration. Every project comes with CI/CD, Docker, benchmarks, and documentation. I deliver complete solutions: code + tests + deployment + training.

## Universal Bio (300 Words)

I'm an AI/ML engineer with 20+ years of software development experience, now focused exclusively on production-grade GenAI systems. I specialize in RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, and enterprise AI integrations -- the kind of systems that need to work at scale, not just in a notebook.

My flagship project, EnterpriseHub, is a real estate AI platform with three specialized chatbots, GoHighLevel CRM integration, Monte Carlo forecasting dashboards, and a 3-tier Redis caching system that reduced LLM costs by 89%. It manages a $50M+ pipeline for the Rancho Cucamonga market.

Beyond that, I've built AgentForge (multi-LLM orchestration achieving 4.3M dispatches/sec), DocQA Engine (document intelligence with BM25/semantic hybrid retrieval), and a suite of developer tools -- all with comprehensive test suites, Docker support, and CI/CD pipelines.

What sets me apart is engineering discipline applied to AI. Every repo has:
- 80%+ test coverage with pytest and TDD methodology
- P50/P95/P99 benchmark suites with published results
- Architecture Decision Records documenting tradeoffs
- Mermaid diagrams, governance files, and structured documentation
- Docker Compose for reproducible deployment

My tech stack centers on Python (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic), PostgreSQL, Redis, and the Claude/GPT-4/Gemini APIs. I work with vector databases (ChromaDB, FAISS), implement Fernet encryption for PII, and build compliant systems (CCPA, GDPR, Fair Housing).

I deliver complete solutions -- not just code. Every engagement includes automated tests, deployment configs, documentation, and knowledge transfer. My async-first, remote-native workflow means daily commits, structured updates, and over-documented decision trails.

Whether you need a custom RAG system, an AI chatbot integration, or a production ML pipeline, I bring the engineering rigor that turns AI experiments into reliable business tools.

## Universal Bio (500 Words)

I'm a senior AI/ML engineer with 20+ years of software development experience, specializing in production-grade Generative AI systems that deliver measurable business outcomes. My focus is on RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, LLM cost optimization, and enterprise AI integrations.

**The Problem I Solve**: Most AI projects stall between proof-of-concept and production. I bridge that gap with engineering discipline -- comprehensive testing, caching strategies, monitoring, and deployment automation. I don't build demos; I build systems that run in production with SLAs.

**Flagship Project -- EnterpriseHub**: A full-stack real estate AI platform with three specialized chatbot personas (lead qualification, buyer guidance, seller CMA), GoHighLevel CRM integration with real-time sync, Monte Carlo simulation dashboards, and predictive analytics. The 3-tier Redis caching system (L1/L2/L3) achieves an 88% cache hit rate and reduced LLM API costs by 89%. The system manages a $50M+ real estate pipeline with <200ms orchestration overhead at P99.

**AgentForge -- Multi-LLM Orchestration**: A production framework for coordinating Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini with automatic failover, cost-aware routing, and agent memory. The core engine processes 4.3M tool dispatches per second with comprehensive guardrails and audit trails.

**DocQA Engine -- Document Intelligence**: Enterprise document Q&A with hybrid BM25/semantic retrieval, cross-encoder re-ranking, multi-hop reasoning, and conversation memory. Built for compliance-heavy industries where accuracy and traceability matter.

**Engineering Standards Across All Projects**:
- 11 production repositories with 8,500+ automated tests (pytest, TDD)
- 33 Architecture Decision Records across 10 repos
- P50/P95/P99 benchmark suites with published RESULTS.md
- Docker + Docker Compose for every project
- GitHub Actions CI/CD on every repository -- all green
- Mermaid architecture diagrams, CHANGELOG, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- 80%+ test coverage as a minimum standard

**Technical Stack**:
- **AI/ML**: Claude API, GPT-4, Gemini, RAG (BM25/TF-IDF/semantic), Multi-Agent Systems, Prompt Engineering
- **Backend**: FastAPI (async), SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Alembic
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis (3-tier caching), ChromaDB, FAISS
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions, monitoring with P50/P95/P99 alerting
- **Security**: Fernet encryption, JWT, OAuth 2.0, PII protection, CCPA/GDPR compliance

**What Makes Me Different**:
1. **Production quality, not prototypes** -- every project has tests, CI, Docker, docs
2. **Business-first engineering** -- I measure cost reduction, latency, and ROI, not just accuracy
3. **Complete delivery** -- code + tests + docs + deployment + training + handoff
4. **Verified metrics** -- 89% cost reduction, 4.3M dispatches/sec, 88% cache hit rate
5. **Domain expertise** -- real estate AI, document processing, CRM integration, compliance

**Work Style**: Remote-first, async communication, daily commits, structured documentation. I over-communicate and over-document by default. Every PR includes context, every decision is recorded, every metric is benchmarked.
