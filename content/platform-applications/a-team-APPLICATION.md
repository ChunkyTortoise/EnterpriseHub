## Platform Overview

A.Team is a curated network of senior builders (engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists) trusted by Fortune 500s and high-growth startups for their most consequential AI initiatives. They connect elite teams for high-impact missions -- not individual gig work.

**Why A.Team matters**: 80% of A.Team builders say GenAI increases their earning potential. 92% report AI tools increase productivity. The platform is positioned at the intersection of elite talent and enterprise AI demand -- exactly where Cayman's skills sit.

**Key differentiator vs Upwork/Fiverr**: Mission-based work with curated teams, not individual commodity gigs. You set your rate. A.Team handles contracts, invoicing, payments.

**Payment**: Biweekly payouts after 400 hours. Before that, within 30 days of invoicing.

## Tailored Profile for A.Team

### Headline
**Senior AI/ML Engineer | GenAI Systems, RAG Pipelines, Multi-Agent Orchestration**

### Specialization Tags
GenAI, RAG/Vector DB, LLM Orchestration, Claude API, GPT-4, Multi-Agent Systems, FastAPI, Production AI Systems

### Impact Statement
"I build production AI systems that ship -- not prototypes. My AgentForge engine processes 4.3M dispatches/sec. My caching architecture reduced LLM costs by 89%. Every system comes with 80%+ test coverage, Docker deployment, and P50/P95/P99 benchmarks."

### Mission Fit Areas
1. **Enterprise RAG Systems** -- Hybrid BM25/semantic retrieval, cross-encoder re-ranking, document intelligence
2. **AI Chatbot Orchestration** -- Multi-persona bots with handoff logic, confidence thresholds, CRM integration
3. **LLM Cost Optimization** -- 3-tier caching, model routing, token efficiency engineering
4. **Multi-Agent Architectures** -- Agent mesh coordination, governance, auto-scaling, audit trails
5. **AI-Powered Analytics** -- Monte Carlo simulations, predictive modeling, Streamlit dashboards

### Key Projects for A.Team Profile

**EnterpriseHub** (Flagship)
- Real estate AI platform with 3 specialized chatbots orchestrating Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini
- GoHighLevel CRM integration with real-time sync and 10 req/s rate limiting
- 89% LLM cost reduction via 3-tier Redis caching
- ~5,100 automated tests, full CI/CD, Docker deployment

**AgentForge**
- Multi-LLM orchestration framework: 4.3M tool dispatches/sec
- Agent memory, guardrails, automatic failover between Claude/GPT-4/Gemini
- ReAct agent loops, evaluation framework, model registry
- ~550 tests, benchmarks, Docker

**DocQA Engine**
- Document intelligence with hybrid RAG (BM25 + semantic + cross-encoder)
- Multi-hop reasoning, conversation memory, answer quality evaluation
- REST API with auth, rate limiting, metering
- ~500 tests, Docker, CI/CD

### What to Emphasize on the Call
1. **Scale of production work**: 8,500+ tests isn't hobby-project territory -- this is enterprise engineering discipline
2. **Business outcomes**: 89% cost reduction, $50M pipeline managed, not just technical metrics
3. **Complete delivery mindset**: Code + tests + docs + deployment + training
4. **GenAI depth**: Not just API wrappers -- caching, orchestration, failover, cost optimization
5. **Team player with documentation**: ADRs, Mermaid diagrams, structured PRs

## Step-by-Step Application Guide

### Pre-Application Checklist
- [ ] Update LinkedIn to 100% completeness (currently ~85%)
- [ ] Get 3-5 LinkedIn recommendations (currently pending)
- [ ] Ensure GitHub repos are public with polished READMEs
- [ ] Prepare 2-3 "impact stories" for the call

### Application Steps

**Step 1**: Go to [a.team/join](https://www.a.team/join)

**Step 2**: Submit profile with LinkedIn URL (linkedin.com/in/caymanroden)

**Step 3**: In any free-text fields, use this positioning:
> Senior AI/ML Engineer specializing in production GenAI systems. 20+ years software experience. Built multi-agent orchestration achieving 4.3M dispatches/sec, RAG pipelines with hybrid retrieval, and LLM cost optimization delivering 89% reduction. 11 production repos, 8,500+ automated tests. Seeking high-impact AI missions with enterprise clients.

**Step 4**: If asked about rate expectations, anchor at $100-150/hr (A.Team projects command premium rates)

**Step 5**: For the screening call, prepare these talking points:
- "I focus on the gap between AI PoC and production -- the 89% cost reduction came from caching architecture that most teams skip"
- "My engineering discipline (8,500+ tests, ADRs, benchmarks) means I can integrate into existing teams without creating tech debt"
- "I'm particularly excited about multi-agent systems -- my AgentForge handles 4.3M dispatches/sec with governance and audit trails"

### Timeline
- Application submission: 15 minutes
- Wait for Stage 1 response: 1-2 weeks
- Screening call: 30 minutes
- Final decision: 1-2 weeks after call
- **Total**: 2-4 weeks from application to acceptance

### Rate Strategy for A.Team
A.Team projects typically command $100-200/hr for senior AI engineers. Position at $125/hr initially, with flexibility for longer missions. This is above Upwork rates but appropriate for the caliber of A.Team clients (Fortune 500, funded startups).
