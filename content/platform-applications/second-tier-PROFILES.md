Specialties: GenAI system architecture, RAG pipeline design, multi-agent orchestration, LLM cost optimization. I've built systems managing $50M+ pipelines with 89% cost reduction through intelligent caching.

**What I Bring**:
- Architecture design and tech stack decisions (33 ADRs across portfolio)
- AI/ML strategy: which models, when to cache, how to test
- Hands-on implementation with production quality (8,500+ tests)
- Team mentoring on TDD, CI/CD, documentation practices

### Application Strategy
- Position as fractional CTO, not just a developer
- Emphasize architecture and leadership experience alongside coding
