## Screening Process (4 Stages)

### Stage 1: Language & Communication Interview
- **Format**: Video call, ~15-30 minutes
- **What they assess**: English fluency, communication clarity, personality, passion for work
- **Cayman's advantage**: Native English speaker, 20+ years professional communication
- **Prep**: None needed -- natural conversation about background and motivation

### Stage 2: Technical Assessment (Codility/HackerRank Style)
- **Format**: Online timed test, 90 minutes, 3 algorithmic problems
- **What they assess**: CS fundamentals, problem-solving, coding speed
- **Difficulty**: Medium-hard LeetCode equivalent
- **Language**: Python (choose your strongest)
- **Pass strategy**: Solve 2 of 3 problems correctly. Partial solutions help.

#### Prep Plan for Stage 2
- [ ] Practice 20-30 medium LeetCode problems in Python (focus on arrays, strings, trees, dynamic programming)
- [ ] Do 3-5 timed Codility practice tests at [codility.com/programmers/lessons](https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/)
- [ ] Review Python-specific patterns: defaultdict, Counter, heapq, itertools, functools.lru_cache
- [ ] Practice under time pressure: 30 min per problem maximum
- [ ] Key topics: sorting, binary search, BFS/DFS, dynamic programming, sliding window, hash maps

### Stage 3: Live Technical Interview
- **Format**: Live screen-share with a Toptal screener (senior expert in your domain)
- **Duration**: ~60-90 minutes
- **What they assess**: Problem-solving ability, depth of experience, communication, creativity
- **Format**: Live coding exercises + technical discussion
- **Cayman's advantage**: Deep FastAPI/Python expertise, production system experience

#### Prep Plan for Stage 3
- [ ] Be ready to build a small FastAPI app live (CRUD, auth, database)
- [ ] Practice explaining architectural decisions aloud while coding
- [ ] Prepare to discuss: async patterns, SQLAlchemy models, Pydantic validation, Redis caching
- [ ] Have examples ready of complex bugs you've debugged
- [ ] Practice talking through trade-offs: "I chose X over Y because..."

### Stage 4: Test Project
- **Format**: Take-home project, 1-3 weeks
- **What they assess**: Thoroughness, professionalism, code quality, documentation
- **Typical scope**: Build a small but complete application demonstrating expertise
- **Cayman's massive advantage**: This is where 8,500+ tests and ADRs shine

#### Prep Plan for Stage 4
- [ ] Treat it like a real production project: tests, Docker, README, CI
- [ ] Include: error handling, input validation, logging, type hints
- [ ] Add a brief ADR explaining key design decisions
- [ ] Write clear setup instructions (someone should be able to run it in <5 min)
- [ ] Over-deliver: if they ask for basic CRUD, add caching, rate limiting, health checks

## 3 Strongest Portfolio Projects for Toptal

### Project 1: EnterpriseHub (Best for "System Design" Impression)
- **Why**: Shows full-stack AI system design at scale -- not a tutorial project
- **Highlight**: 3-tier caching reducing LLM costs by 89%, multi-bot orchestration, CRM integration
- **Evidence**: ~5,100 tests, Docker Compose, 5 ADRs, benchmark results
- **Talking point**: "This is a production system managing a $50M real estate pipeline"

### Project 2: AgentForge (Best for "AI/ML Depth" Impression)
- **Why**: Shows deep understanding of LLM orchestration, not just API wrapping
- **Highlight**: 4.3M dispatches/sec, agent memory, guardrails, multi-model failover
- **Evidence**: ~550 tests, 3 ADRs, benchmark suite, ReAct agent implementation
- **Talking point**: "Most multi-agent frameworks are demos -- this one has governance and audit trails"

### Project 3: DocQA Engine (Best for "Production RAG" Impression)
- **Why**: RAG is the hottest enterprise AI use case, and this shows production-grade implementation
- **Highlight**: Hybrid BM25/semantic retrieval, cross-encoder re-ranking, multi-hop reasoning
- **Evidence**: ~500 tests, REST API with auth/rate-limiting, Docker deployment
- **Talking point**: "I've implemented the full retrieval stack, not just 'embed and search'"
