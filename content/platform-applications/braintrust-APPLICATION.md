## Platform Overview

Braintrust is the first decentralized talent network, connecting pre-vetted technical freelancers with major enterprises (Nestle, Porsche, Atlassian, Goldman Sachs, Nike). Built on blockchain with the BTRST token for community governance.

**Why Braintrust matters**:
1. **0% fee to talent** -- you keep 100% of what clients pay (vs Upwork's 10-20%)
2. **Enterprise clients** -- Fortune 500 companies, not small businesses
3. **Community-owned** -- earn BTRST tokens for vetting talent, referring clients
4. **Pre-vetted on both sides** -- clients are vetted too (must pay top rates, have clear scopes)
