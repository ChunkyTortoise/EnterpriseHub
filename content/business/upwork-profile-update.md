# Upwork Profile Update -- Cayman Roden

**Generated**: 2026-02-18 | **Purpose**: Optimized profile copy for upwork.com/freelancers/caymanroden

## 1. Headline Options (max 80 chars)

```
Option A: I Cut LLM Costs 89% | RAG, Multi-Agent Systems, FastAPI | Python     (68 chars) [RECOMMENDED]
Option B: RAG & AI Agent Engineer | 89% Cost Reduction, 8,500+ Tests | Python  (72 chars)
Option C: Production AI Systems | RAG, Agents, LLM Optimization | 8,500 Tests  (72 chars)
```

**Recommendation: Option A.**

It leads with a verifiable outcome ("I Cut LLM Costs 89%"), not a job title. Upwork buyers scan headlines in search results -- a number and a dollar-sign-adjacent claim stops the scroll. Option B is the fallback if the first-person phrasing feels too aggressive. Option C is the safest but weakest -- it buries the metric at the end where it gets truncated in mobile search.

## 2. Professional Overview

**Character count**: ~4,900 (within Upwork's 5,000-char limit)

---

Your AI prototype works in a notebook. It falls apart under real traffic. The LLM bills are climbing. The codebase has no tests. Your team can't debug it because nobody documented how the retrieval pipeline actually works.

I fix that.

I build production AI systems -- RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, LLM-powered chatbots -- that run under real load, ship with automated test suites, and are documented well enough that your engineers can maintain them after the engagement ends. I've been writing software professionally for 20+ years. The last several have been focused exclusively on taking GenAI systems from proof-of-concept to production.

**What I Build**

RAG & Document Intelligence -- Hybrid retrieval systems combining BM25, TF-IDF, and semantic search with cross-encoder re-ranking. I build these with schema-per-tenant isolation in PostgreSQL + pgvector, PII detection and redaction, and query expansion. My DocQA Engine handles multi-hop reasoning over complex document sets. One platform I built serves multi-tenant RAG with Stripe usage-based billing, tier-based rate limiting (Free through Enterprise), and 120 tests verifying tenant isolation under concurrent load.

Multi-Agent Orchestration -- Production agent pipelines with circuit breakers, cost-aware model routing, agent memory, guardrails, and evaluation frameworks. My AgentForge engine processes 4.3M tool dispatches per second with P99 overhead under 0.095ms. I've built handoff systems with circular prevention, rate limiting, pattern learning from outcomes, and performance-based routing that auto-defers when a downstream agent degrades.

AI Chatbots with CRM Integration -- Conversational bots that qualify leads, detect intent, and sync to GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce in real time. I built a real estate AI platform with three specialized bot personas (Lead, Buyer, Seller) managing a $50M+ pipeline. Temperature tagging, calendar booking, custom field mapping, workflow triggers -- all wired end to end with 157 passing tests on the bot layer alone.

LLM Cost Optimization -- A 3-tier Redis caching architecture (L1 in-memory, L2 Redis, L3 PostgreSQL) that achieved an 88% cache hit rate and cut one system's LLM API costs by 89%. I build fallback chains, streaming pipelines, and token budgeting systems so your AI features scale without burning money.

Analytics Dashboards -- Streamlit apps with Monte Carlo simulation, anomaly detection, SHAP explanations, and churn prediction. Three live demos running right now.

**Why the Numbers Matter**

I don't list metrics to impress -- I list them because they're how I work. Every project gets:

- 8,500+ automated tests across 11 production repositories, all CI green
- P50/P95/P99 benchmark suites with published results (not "we ran it once")
- 33 Architecture Decision Records documenting design tradeoffs
- Docker + Docker Compose for reproducible deployment
- 80%+ test coverage as a baseline, not a stretch goal

When I hand you the codebase, your team isn't inheriting a mystery. They're inheriting a documented, tested, benchmarked system with a clear maintenance path.

**How I Work**

TDD from day one. Async Python (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic). Docker for every project. GitHub Actions CI/CD on every repository. No framework bloat -- I use pure Python with well-chosen libraries, so the code is readable and your team doesn't need to learn a custom framework to maintain it. Daily commits, async communication, structured handoff notes. I over-document by default.

**Tech Stack**

Python 3.11+ | FastAPI | SQLAlchemy | Pydantic v2 | PostgreSQL | Redis | Docker | GitHub Actions | Claude API | GPT-4 | Gemini | ChromaDB | FAISS | pgvector | Stripe | Streamlit | Playwright | Twilio | Deepgram | ElevenLabs

**What I Don't Do**

No WordPress plugins. No web scraping for spam. No prototype-only throwaway work. No "it works on my machine" deliveries. If it doesn't have tests, CI, docs, and a deployment path, I haven't finished.

**Who I Work Best With**

Startups building their first AI product who need it done right the first time. Engineering teams bolting AI onto an existing stack who need someone who understands both sides. Agencies shipping AI-powered products to their clients who need a backend that won't embarrass them. Teams with a broken AI prototype that needs to actually deploy.

**Next Step**

Message me with what you're building. I'll tell you within 24 hours if I can help -- and if I can, I'll send you a relevant live demo before we even get on a call.

## 3. Hourly Rate Recommendation

**Current rate**: $65-75/hr (general profile), $55/hr (specialized RAG profile)

**Recommendation**: Raise the general profile to **$85/hr** now. Keep the RAG specialized profile at $65/hr until you have 3+ reviews.

**Justification**:

The existing $65-75/hr rate was set as an entry strategy before the portfolio was complete. Since then:

- multi-agent-starter-kit v2.0 shipped with HITL gates, Agentic RAG, and an evaluation framework (101 tests)
- 3 Streamlit demos are live and linkable
- 1 PyPI package published (mcp-server-toolkit)
- 15 proposal submissions have calibrated the market -- $100-150/hr is standard for RAG/agent specialists with verifiable production work
- Fiverr gigs are priced at $300-$2,000/project (implying $75-150/hr effective)

The Upwork market for AI/ML engineers in 2026 splits cleanly:

| Tier | Rate Range | Profile |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Generalist Python + "some AI" | $35-55/hr | Tutorials, basic API wrappers |
| Specialist with portfolio | $75-120/hr | Production systems, tests, docs |
| Architect / Advisory | $150-300/hr | Design reviews, audits, strategy |

Your portfolio puts you firmly in the specialist tier. Pricing at $65/hr signals "junior" to clients who can pay $100+. At $85/hr, you filter out tire-kickers while staying accessible to startups with real budgets.

**Rate ladder going forward**:

| Trigger | New Rate |
|---------|----------|
| Now (portfolio v2.0 complete) | $85/hr |
| After 3 five-star reviews | $100/hr |
| After Top Rated badge (90+ JSS) | $120/hr |
| Inbound > outbound proposals | $150/hr |

For the RAG specialized profile (currently $55/hr), raise to $65/hr now and $85/hr after first review on that profile.

## 4. Top Skills (Ranked)

Ordered by Upwork buyer search volume and relevance to the highest-paying jobs.

```
1.  Python
2.  Large Language Models (LLM)
3.  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
4.  AI Agent Development
5.  FastAPI
6.  Chatbot Development
7.  API Development
8.  Prompt Engineering
9.  Natural Language Processing (NLP)
10. PostgreSQL
```

**Rationale**: Python is the #1 filter for nearly every AI job on Upwork. LLM and RAG are the two highest-growth skill tags in 2025-2026. AI Agent Development captures the multi-agent wave. FastAPI signals backend depth (vs. Flask/Django generalists). Chatbot and API Development match how non-technical buyers search. Prompt Engineering and NLP round out the AI stack. PostgreSQL signals real database work, not just SQLite tutorials.

Skills 11-15 (overflow, add if Upwork allows more slots):

```
11. Redis
12. Docker
13. Streamlit
14. ChatGPT API
15. Data Pipeline
```
