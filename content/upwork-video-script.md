# Upwork Video Intro Script — 60 Seconds

## [0-5s] Opening Hook
"Hey, I'm Cayman — I'm an AI engineer who builds production systems that actually ship."

## [5-20s] What I Build
"I specialize in three things: LLM orchestration — connecting Claude, GPT, and Gemini into reliable multi-agent workflows. RAG pipelines — document search systems that actually cite their sources. And data dashboards — upload a CSV, get forecasting, clustering, and anomaly detection without writing a line of code."

## [20-40s] Proof Points
"This isn't theoretical. I've built 11 open-source repositories with over 7,000 automated tests — all with green CI pipelines. Five of them have live Streamlit demos you can try right now, no signup required. My flagship platform handles multi-agent chatbot orchestration with under 200 milliseconds latency and cut LLM costs by 89 percent through intelligent caching."

## [40-50s] Differentiator
"What sets me apart: I don't just write code — I deliver complete solutions. Every project includes comprehensive tests, documentation, Docker deployment, and monitoring. When I hand off a system, you can deploy it to production the same day. Not eventually — that day."

## [50-60s] CTA
"If you're building AI-powered products and need an engineer who ships production-grade work, let's talk. I'm available for contract work at 65 to 75 dollars an hour. Drop me a message and let's discuss your project."

## Delivery Notes
