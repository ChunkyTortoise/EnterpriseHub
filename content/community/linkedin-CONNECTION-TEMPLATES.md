# LinkedIn Connection Request Templates

**Constraint**: Each must be under 300 characters (LinkedIn connection note limit)
**Rule**: Always personalize the {bracketed} fields before sending. Never send the template verbatim.

## Template 1: GHL Agency Owner

```
Hi {first_name}, I saw your work with {their_agency_or_post_topic} on GHL. I build AI lead qualification systems on GoHighLevel -- always interested to connect with people pushing the platform further. Would love to exchange notes.
```

**Character count**: ~250 (varies with personalization)
**When to use**: After engaging with their content, or finding them in the GHL Facebook Group

## Template 2: PropTech Founder

```
Hi {first_name}, {their_company} caught my eye -- {specific_thing_they_do}. I work on AI-powered CRM integrations for real estate (lead qualification, bot orchestration). Would be great to connect and follow your work.
```

**Character count**: ~240 (varies with personalization)
**When to use**: After seeing their company on LinkedIn, AngelList, or in a PropTech community

## Template 3: SaaS CTO / Engineering Leader

```
Hi {first_name}, your post on {topic_they_posted_about} resonated. I've been building multi-agent AI systems with production caching (88% hit rate, sub-200ms P95). Always good to connect with engineers who think about systems at scale.
```

**Character count**: ~270 (varies with personalization)
**When to use**: After commenting on their technical post, or finding them through a shared connection

## Personalization Checklist

Before sending any template:

- [ ] Replace ALL {bracketed} placeholders with real information
- [ ] Reference something SPECIFIC about their work (not "I love what you do")
- [ ] Verify you're under 300 characters after personalization
- [ ] Make sure you've engaged with at least one of their posts first (like or comment)
- [ ] Do NOT mention pricing, services, or "let's hop on a call" in the connection request

## Follow-Up Strategy (After Connection Accepted)

Wait 2-3 days after they accept. Then send ONE message:

```
Thanks for connecting, {first_name}. No pitch here -- just wanted to say
{specific_compliment_about_their_work}. If you're ever working on
{relevant_topic}, happy to share what I've learned building AI on GHL.
```

Then go silent. Let the relationship develop through content engagement, not DMs.
