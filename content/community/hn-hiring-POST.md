## Post Content

```
Location: Palm Springs, CA
Remote: Yes (remote only)
Willing to relocate: No
Technologies: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Claude/GPT APIs, RAG systems, multi-agent orchestration, GoHighLevel CRM, Docker, GitHub Actions
Resume/Portfolio: https://chunkytortoise.github.io | https://github.com/ChunkyTortoise

20+ years software engineering. Currently focused on production AI systems -- multi-agent orchestration, RAG pipelines, and CRM integrations.

Recent work: Built a lead qualification system for a real estate brokerage using 3 specialized AI bots (buyer, seller, lead triage) with cross-bot handoff logic, 3-tier caching (88% hit rate), and full GoHighLevel integration. Sub-200ms P95 latency, 89% below projected LLM costs. 8,500+ tests across the portfolio.

What I bring:
- Production AI, not demos. Everything ships with tests, CI/CD, monitoring, and docs.
- Multi-agent systems: bot-to-bot handoffs, intent detection, confidence thresholds, pattern learning from outcome history.
- CRM integration depth: GoHighLevel Contact API, tag-based routing, webhook processing, pipeline sync.
- Cost engineering: 3-tier Redis/PG caching, model selection routing (Sonnet for simple, Opus for complex), token optimization.

Looking for: Contract or full-time roles involving AI systems engineering, LLM integration, or platform automation. Particularly interested in teams building AI on top of existing platforms (CRMs, ERPs, vertical SaaS) rather than greenfield LLM wrappers.

Happy to share architecture diagrams and code samples. DM or email: caymanroden@gmail.com

**Posting Notes**:
- Post within first 2 hours of the thread going live (typically ~9 AM PT on the 1st)
- HN audience values specificity over marketing language. Every claim has a number attached.
- Do NOT mention pricing or rates in the HN post. Keep it technical.
- The portfolio link should be live and showing recent work before posting.
- If someone asks a follow-up question in the thread, respond with the same level of technical specificity.
