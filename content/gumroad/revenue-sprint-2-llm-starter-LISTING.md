### Pro -- $99

**Title**: AI Integration Starter Kit -- Pro

**Description**:

Everything in Starter, plus production hardening: retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern, response caching, batch processing, and observability. Ship LLM features that don't break at scale.

**What You Get (in addition to Starter):**
- Retry with exponential backoff and jitter
- Circuit breaker for external API resilience
- Response caching (in-memory and Redis)
- Batch processor for bulk LLM operations
- Guardrails framework (content filtering, rate limiting)
- Latency tracker with P50/P95/P99 percentiles
- Fallback chain (primary → fallback provider)
- CLI tool (`llm-starter`) for terminal workflows
- Extended documentation with architecture guide

**Ideal For:**
- Production applications with real users
- Teams needing reliability guarantees
- Engineers optimizing LLM costs at scale

### Enterprise -- $249

**Title**: AI Integration Starter Kit -- Enterprise

**Description**:

Full starter kit with commercial license, priority support, and enterprise features. Everything in Pro plus multi-provider orchestration, observability pipeline, and dedicated support.

**What You Get (in addition to Pro):**
- Multi-provider orchestration (route to cheapest/fastest provider)
- Structured observability pipeline (logging, metrics, traces)
- Mock LLM for testing (no API calls needed)
- Docker deployment files
- CI/CD workflow templates
- Kubernetes manifests
- Commercial license (unlimited team members)
- 30-day priority email support
