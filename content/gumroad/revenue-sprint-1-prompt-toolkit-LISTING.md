## Key Selling Points

1. **190 automated tests** -- Not a tutorial or template collection. Production-grade code.
2. **8 proven patterns** -- Each pattern includes explanation, use cases, and working code.
3. **Cost tracking built in** -- Know exactly what each prompt costs before production.
4. **A/B testing** -- Measure which prompts actually perform better.
5. **No vendor lock-in** -- Works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any LLM.
