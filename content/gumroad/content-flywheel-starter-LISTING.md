## Full Product Description

# Stop Writing the Same Content 6 Times

You have one great technical topic. You need it on LinkedIn, Twitter, Dev.to, your newsletter, Reddit, and YouTube. That's 6 different formats, 6 different audiences, 6 different content styles.

Most people either:
- Write one post and cross-post it everywhere (low engagement)
- Write all 6 from scratch (10+ hours per topic)
- Give up after 2 platforms (missed audience)

The Content Flywheel Starter Kit gives you a system to turn 1 input topic into 6 platform-optimized outputs in under 2 hours.
