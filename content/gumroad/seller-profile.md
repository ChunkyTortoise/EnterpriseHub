# Gumroad Creator Profile — Cayman Roden

## Creator Name
Cayman Roden

## Bio (appears on creator page)

I'm an AI engineer who builds production-ready tools that save developers weeks of integration work. Over the past year, I've shipped 11 open-source repositories with 7,016 automated tests — all with passing CI pipelines and live demos. These aren't weekend tutorials repackaged as products. They're battle-tested systems built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, and modern LLM APIs.

Every starter kit in this collection comes from a real production system. The RAG pipeline powers a document Q&A platform processing 1,000+ pages in under 2 seconds. The orchestrator runs multi-LLM workflows with circuit breakers and fallback chains. The analytics engine generates forecasts and clustering from raw CSV uploads. They work because they were built to work — with comprehensive test suites, error handling, and deployment automation included.

I believe good tools should be accessible. All kits include full source code, complete test suites, Docker configuration, documentation, and MIT licensing for commercial use. You get 90 days of updates and a codebase you can extend, modify, and deploy without restrictions.
