## Upwork / Fiverr Certifications Section

```
Currently pursuing the Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer (PMLE) certification
(12-week structured study plan) and AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty (MLS-C01)
(16-week plan). Alongside formal certification, I completed DeepLearning.AI's Generative
AI with LLMs fast-track. My production work — including RAG pipelines, multi-agent
orchestration handling 4.3M tool dispatches/sec, and 89% LLM cost reduction — reflects
the applied ML engineering these certifications validate.
```

Short variant:
```
Actively pursuing Google PMLE and AWS ML Specialty certifications. My production AI
systems — RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, LLM cost optimization — are the
applied counterpart to these credentials.

## Framing Notes

- "Candidate" = standard industry term for active study plan + exam scheduled. Used by Google/AWS/Microsoft.
- "Pursuing" = appropriate for planned but not yet active study.
- Never use "certified" or trademark logos until credential posts to Credly / Google Cloud Skills.
- Always pair cert mentions with production metrics — they prove the cert validates real work.
