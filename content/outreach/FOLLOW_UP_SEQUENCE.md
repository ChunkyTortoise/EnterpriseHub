### Email Template #1A: Soft Nudge (Assume They're Busy)

**Subject:** Re: {{original_subject}}

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick follow-up on my email from earlier this week about {{brief_topic_summary}}.

I know {{company}} is likely heads-down on {{relevant_initiative}} right now, so no worries if the timing isn't right.

That said, I wanted to make sure you saw the live demo: {{demo_url}}

It's a self-guided walkthrough - you can explore it in 5 minutes on your schedule without needing to jump on a call.

If this isn't a priority right now, totally understand. Just reply "not now" and I'll check back in a few months.

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Tone:** Understanding, low-pressure, provides async option

**Best For:** Professional, enterprise targets (AI startups, consulting firms, healthcare/legal)

---

### Email Template #1B: Value Reinforcement (Emphasize Benefit)

**Subject:** Re: {{original_subject}}

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my earlier email about {{specific_value_prop}}.

I realized I should have led with this: {{compelling_stat_or_case_study}}.

For {{company}}, this could mean:
- {{benefit_1}}
- {{benefit_2}}
- {{benefit_3}}

Live demo here: {{demo_url}}

Worth 15 minutes to explore? I can walk you through how this applies to {{their_specific_use_case}}.

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Tone:** Direct, benefit-focused, quantifiable value

**Best For:** ROI-driven targets (agencies, e-commerce, real estate tech)

---

### Email Template #1C: Social Proof (Credibility Boost)

**Subject:** Re: {{original_subject}}

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Circling back on my earlier email.

Since I sent that, I realized you might want to see the portfolio first: https://chunkytortoise.github.io

**Highlights:**
- 11 production repos, 7,016 automated tests
- 6 live Streamlit demos (not prototypes - real production systems)
- {{most_relevant_project}} directly applicable to {{their_use_case}}

Demo: {{demo_url}}

If {{company}} is working on {{their_ai_initiative}}, I'd love to show you how this could accelerate your roadmap. 15-minute call work?

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Tone:** Credibility-focused, portfolio-driven

**Best For:** Technical audiences, CTOs, engineering leads

---

## Follow-Up Email #2 (Day 7)

### Subject Line Options

| Variant | Subject Line | Use When |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **A** | Re: {{original_subject}} | Maintains thread |
| **B** | Last ping - {{company_name}} | Creates urgency without being pushy |
| **C** | Breakup email? | Humorous, disarming |

**Recommended:** Variant C (performs surprisingly well, breaks pattern)

---

### Email Template #2A: The Breakup Email (High-Performing)

**Subject:** Breakup email?

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple times about {{brief_topic}} but haven't heard back.

I get it - you're busy, or this isn't a priority, or my timing is terrible. All totally valid!

Before I take the hint and stop bothering you, quick question:

**Should I:**
a) Follow up in 3 months when timing might be better?
b) Remove you from my list entirely?
c) Send you a 5-minute demo you can review on your schedule (no obligation)?

Just reply with a), b), or c) and I'll do exactly that.

No hard feelings either way - best of luck with {{company}}'s growth!

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Tone:** Humorous, self-aware, gives recipient control

**Why It Works:** Breaks pattern, shows respect for their time, low-pressure

**Best For:** All audiences (especially effective for busy executives)

---

### Email Template #2B: New Information (Re-Engagement Hook)

**Subject:** Re: {{original_subject}} - New update

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Following up one more time.

Since my last email, {{new_development}}:
- {{new_feature_or_case_study}}
- {{updated_demo_or_resource}}

This is particularly relevant for {{company}} because {{specific_application}}.

Updated demo: {{demo_url}}

If you're still not interested, no worries at all - just let me know and I'll stop reaching out.

Otherwise, would 15 minutes this week work for a quick walkthrough?

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Tone:** Informative, provides new value

**Best For:** When you have genuine updates (new feature, case study, pricing change)

---

### Email Template #2C: The Direct Ask (Straightforward)

**Subject:** Re: {{original_subject}}

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out twice about {{topic}} but haven't heard back.

I don't want to keep bothering you if this isn't relevant.

**Simple ask:** Is this something {{company}} might be interested in at some point, or should I remove you from my list?

Either answer is totally fine - I just want to respect your inbox.

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Tone:** Direct, respectful, clear CTA

**Best For:** Professional, no-nonsense audiences

---

## Follow-Up Email #3 (Day 14) - Final Touch

### Subject Line Options

| Variant | Subject Line | Use When |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **A** | Last email, I promise | Clear, final outreach |
| **B** | {{company}} + {{your_company}} - last thought | Professional close |
| **C** | Closing the loop | Clean, respectful |

**Recommended:** Variant A (clear expectations, performs well)

---

### Email Template #3A: The Final Goodbye (Permission-Based)

**Subject:** Last email, I promise

```
Hi {{first_name}},

This is my last email - I promise!

I've reached out a few times about {{topic}} without hearing back. I'm taking that as a sign this isn't the right time or fit for {{company}}.

**Before I go:**

If you're even 1% curious, here's the demo one last time: {{demo_url}}

If not, totally okay! I'll remove you from my outreach list and won't bug you again.

Either way, I genuinely wish you the best with {{company}}'s {{relevant_initiative}}.

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Tone:** Respectful, final, leaves door open

**Why It Works:** Creates "last chance" urgency without being pushy

---

### Email Template #3B: The Long-Term Nurture Offer

**Subject:** Last email, I promise - Staying in touch?

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about {{topic}} without hearing back, so I'm assuming now's not the right time.

No worries at all!

**Would you like me to:**

**Option A:** Check back in 6 months when timing might be better?
**Option B:** Add you to my quarterly newsletter (AI engineering deep-dives, not sales spam)?
**Option C:** Remove you entirely (no hard feelings)?

Just reply A, B, or C and I'll do exactly that.

Best of luck with {{company}}'s growth!

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Tone:** Flexible, offers multiple engagement levels

**Best For:** High-value targets you don't want to lose completely

### Email Template #3C: The "Hail Mary" Value Bomb

**Subject:** Last thought for {{company}}

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I know I've reached out a few times, so this is my last email.

Before I go, I wanted to share something that might be valuable even if we don't work together:

{{actionable_tip_or_resource_they_can_use}}

Example:
"If you're building RAG systems, here's a free open-source framework I built that might save your team weeks: [github_link]. No strings attached - it's yours to use however you want."

If {{company}} ever needs AI engineering help, you know where to find me.

Otherwise, best of luck!

{{your_name}}
```

**Tone:** Generous, no-strings-attached value

**Why It Works:** Demonstrates expertise, builds goodwill, leaves positive impression

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Response Rates by Follow-Up

| Email | Expected Open Rate | Expected Reply Rate | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Initial** | 25-35% | 2-5% | Highest open rate, lowest reply rate |
| **Follow-Up #1** | 15-25% | 3-7% | Catches people who missed initial |
| **Follow-Up #2** | 10-20% | 5-10% | "Breakup email" performs well |
| **Follow-Up #3** | 5-15% | 2-5% | Last chance urgency |

### Cumulative Impact

Starting with 30 contacts:
- Initial email: 1-2 replies
- Follow-up #1: 1-2 additional replies
- Follow-up #2: 1-2 additional replies
- Follow-up #3: 0-1 additional replies

**Total Expected Replies: 3-7 out of 30** (10-23% cumulative reply rate)

---

## Stop Conditions

### Immediately Stop Follow-Ups If:
- ✅ Recipient replies (any message)
- ✅ Recipient clicks demo link (shows engagement)
- ✅ Recipient unsubscribes
- ✅ Email bounces (invalid address)
- ✅ Recipient marks as spam

### Continue Follow-Ups If:
- ❌ Email opened but no reply
- ❌ No engagement at all (not opened)

---

## Manual Override Scenarios

### When to Manually Adjust Sequence

**Scenario 1:** They opened all 3 emails but didn't reply
→ Send custom 4th email with different approach (maybe they're interested but busy)

**Scenario 2:** They clicked demo link but didn't reply
→ Skip to direct ask: "I saw you checked out the demo - any questions?"

**Scenario 3:** Out-of-office auto-reply
→ Pause sequence, resume 2 days after their return date

**Scenario 4:** They forwarded email internally
→ Send custom email: "I noticed the email was forwarded - happy to present to your team"
