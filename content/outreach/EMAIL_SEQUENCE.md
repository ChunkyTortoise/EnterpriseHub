## Template 1: AI Startup CTO (RAG Pipeline Pitch)

### Subject Line Options
```
{{option1}}: Quick thought on {{company}}'s AI roadmap
{{option2}}: RAG pipeline question for {{company}}
{{option3}}: {{recent_announcement}} - have you considered...
```

### Email Template

**Subject**: {{subject_line}}

Hi {{first_name}},

{{personalization_hook}}

I noticed {{company_name}} is working on {{specific_ai_project}}. Building production-ready RAG pipelines is notoriously difficult - the gap between "working in Jupyter" and "reliable production system" is where most AI projects stall.

**What we built:**
An enterprise RAG pipeline that handles document ingestion, embeddings, vector search, and query routing - all in a single, deployable system.

**Why it matters for {{company_name}}:**
- {{specific_benefit_1}}
- {{specific_benefit_2}}
- {{specific_benefit_3}}

{{relevant_case_study}}

**Quick demo:** [{{demo_link}}]({{demo_link}})

The demo walks through:
1. Setting up document ingestion in <5 minutes
2. Querying across multiple knowledge bases
3. Production-ready deployment options

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week to discuss how this could fit into {{company}}'s roadmap?

Best,

## Template 2: Agency/Consulting (Instant Dashboards Pitch)

### Subject Line Options
```
{{option1}}: Dashboard solution for {{agency_name}}'s clients
{{option2}}: {{client_reference}} - quick question
{{option3}}: Cutting client reporting time by 80%?
```

### Email Template

**Subject**: {{subject_line}}

Hi {{first_name}},

{{personalization_hook}}

{{agency_name}} delivers incredible results for {{ideal_client_profile}}, but client reporting can eat up 10+ hours per week per account. I built something that might change that.

**What we built:**
A business intelligence dashboard system that creates client-ready reports in minutes, not days.

**Key capabilities:**
- Connect to multiple data sources (ads, CRM, analytics)
- Auto-generate client-facing reports with your branding
- White-label options for full agency customization
- Scheduled delivery - set it and forget it

{{social_proof}}

**See it in action:** [{{demo_link}}]({{demo_link}})

The demo shows:
1. Connecting Google Ads, Meta, and CRM data in <10 minutes
2. Creating a branded client dashboard
3. Setting up weekly automated reports

Could we do a quick 15-minute walkthrough? I'd love to see if this could fit into {{agency_name}}'s service delivery.

Cheers,
