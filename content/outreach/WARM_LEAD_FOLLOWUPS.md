## Lead 1: FloPro Jamaica (Chase) - Contract Offer Follow-Up

**Platform**: Upwork
**Contact**: Chase
**Company**: FloPro Jamaica
**Project**: AI Secretary SaaS
**Status**: Awaiting contract offer at $75/hr
**Last Contact**: Unknown (check Upwork messages)
**Priority**: HIGH (revenue opportunity)

---

### Context

Chase from FloPro Jamaica made a verbal $75/hr contract offer. This is below your standard rate ($85-100/hr) but acceptable as a portfolio builder for first project. Need to formalize the engagement while positioning for future rate increases.

### Strategy

- **Accept $75/hr** for first project (explicitly frame as portfolio-building rate)
- **Set expectation** that standard rate is $85-100/hr for future work
- **Lock in contract** before he moves to another candidate
- **Get scope clarity** to avoid scope creep at reduced rate

---

### Email 1: Accept Offer + Set Expectations

**Subject**: FloPro AI Secretary - Accepting $75/hr for First Project

Hi Chase,

Thanks for the contract offer discussion. I'm excited to work with FloPro Jamaica on the AI Secretary SaaS project.

**I'm accepting the $75/hr rate for this first project.** I typically work at $85-100/hr, but I'm happy to start at $75/hr to build our working relationship and add a SaaS AI project to my portfolio.

Before we formalize the contract, let's align on scope to ensure we're both set up for success:

**What I understand so far:**
- AI-powered secretary/assistant for Jamaican market
- [Add any other details you know from previous conversations]

**What I need from you:**
1. **Scope document**: What features are in scope for the initial engagement?
2. **Tech stack preferences**: Any required technologies or integrations?
3. **Timeline**: What's your target launch date or milestone schedule?
4. **Success criteria**: How will we measure success for this project?

Once we align on these, I'll accept the Upwork contract and we can get started immediately.

For future projects after this one, my standard rate is $85-100/hr depending on scope and complexity. I'm confident this first project will demonstrate the value, and we can build a long-term relationship from there.

Sound good?

Best,

### Email 2: Alternative - If He's Gone Silent

Hi Chase,

Quick follow-up on the FloPro AI Secretary project and the $75/hr contract offer you mentioned.

I'm ready to move forward and can start as early as next week. Here's what I can deliver:

**My expertise directly relevant to your SaaS**:
- AI chatbot orchestration (89% cost reduction on LLM operations)
- Multi-agent conversation design with handoffs
- Production-grade systems (8,500+ automated tests across my portfolio)
- Caribbean market experience (adaptable to Jamaican English and local context)

**Next steps**:
1. Send me the Upwork contract at $75/hr (I'll accept within 24 hours)
2. Share project scope/requirements

If you've decided to go in a different direction, no hard feelings - just let me know so I can plan accordingly.

Either way, best of luck with FloPro!

### Email 3: If No Response After 7 Days - Close Loop

**Subject**: FloPro AI Secretary - Closing the Loop

Hi Chase,

I haven't heard back on the contract offer, so I'm assuming you've moved forward with another developer or the project timeline has shifted.

Totally understand - these things happen!

If the timing changes or you need AI engineering help in the future, feel free to reach out. My Upwork profile is always open, and I'd be happy to work with FloPro Jamaica on future projects.

Best of luck with the AI Secretary launch!

### Upwork Message (Alternative Channel)

**Message 1: Gentle Nudge**

Hi Chase,

Just wanted to circle back on the AI Secretary project and the $75/hr rate we discussed. I'm excited to get started and can begin as early as next week.

Can you send the Upwork contract when you're ready? I'll accept within 24 hours and we can kick off the first sprint.

Let me know if you need anything else from me to move forward.

Best,
Cayman

### Positioning Notes (Internal Use Only)

**Why accept $75/hr?**
- First Upwork contract builds credibility on platform
- SaaS AI project is strong portfolio piece
- Caribbean/Jamaican market is unique differentiator
- Can lead to ongoing retainer or additional projects at higher rate

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Vague scope (risk of infinite scope creep at $75/hr)
- No written requirements (require scope doc before starting)
- "Just start and we'll figure it out" (never accept this)
- Payment concerns (confirm Upwork escrow before starting work)

**Rate escalation plan:**
- Project 1: $75/hr (portfolio builder)
- Project 2+: $85/hr (standard rate, cite successful Project 1)
- Retainer: $2,500-$5,000/mo (pitch after 2-3 successful projects)

## Notes & Lessons Learned

### FloPro Jamaica

**What went well:**
- Secured verbal offer at $75/hr
- Clear project scope (AI Secretary SaaS)
- Caribbean market is unique differentiator

**What to improve:**
- Should have pushed for written scope before accepting offer
- $75/hr is below standard rate - don't make this a pattern
- Need to set expectation for rate increase after first project

**Red flags to watch:**
- If he doesn't send scope doc → potential for infinite scope creep
- If contract has vague deliverables → require clarification before signing
- If he pushes back on rate increase for Project 2 → walk away

---

### Kialash Persad

**What went well:**
- Call was scheduled (shows interest)
- Sr AI Agent Engineer is senior-level role
- Upwork platform provides payment protection

**What to improve:**
- Need to confirm call happened vs missed
- Should have sent calendar reminder 24 hours before
- If call didn't happen, need better calendar management

**Next time:**
- Always send calendar invite (don't rely on just Upwork messages)
- Set 24-hour reminder to confirm call logistics
- Test call software 30 minutes before scheduled time
