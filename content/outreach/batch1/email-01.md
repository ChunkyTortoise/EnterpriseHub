Hi {{first_name}},

Managing lead distribution for 500+ agents is a logistics problem disguised as a sales problem. The brokerages I've talked to are spending 15-30 minutes per lead on manual qualification -- budget verification, timeline assessment, motivation scoring. At scale, that means qualified leads sit in a queue for hours while agents handle the ones that came in first.

I built an AI lead qualification system for a real estate operation in Rancho Cucamonga that solves this. Three specialized bots handle the entire qualification pipeline:

- **Lead Bot**: Scores incoming leads across 10 dimensions (budget, timeline, pre-approval, motivation, and 6 more) in under 60 seconds
- **Buyer Bot**: Deep-qualifies buyers with financial readiness assessment and property matching
- **Seller Bot**: Handles CMA requests, listing consultations, and seller motivation scoring

The system auto-tags leads as Hot, Warm, or Cold and routes them to the right agent instantly. Hot leads trigger priority notifications. Cold leads enter nurture sequences automatically.

Results from production:
- 88.1% cache hit rate (most queries never touch the expensive AI APIs)
- 89% reduction in LLM costs through 3-tier caching
- Zero context loss during bot-to-bot handoffs

I'd be happy to do a **free 15-minute walkthrough** of how this would work for {{company}}'s agent roster. No pitch -- just a look at the architecture and what it could automate for your team.

Worth a quick call?

Best,
