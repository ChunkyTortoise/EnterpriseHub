**Body**:

Hi {{first_name}},

Every listing appointment with an unmotivated seller costs your team 2-3 hours -- drive time, presentation, follow-up -- for a listing that never signs. At scale, that's your most expensive operational waste.

I built a Seller Bot that pre-qualifies listing leads before they ever get to an agent:

- **Motivation scoring**: Assesses seller urgency through natural conversation -- are they "thinking about selling" or "need to sell by March"?
- **Property condition signals**: Identifies renovation status, tenant situations, and other deal complexity factors
- **CMA readiness check**: Gathers property details, timeline expectations, and pricing expectations before the agent call
- **Financial readiness scoring (FRS)**: Evaluates equity position, mortgage status, and financial urgency
- **Property condition scoring (PCS)**: Assesses the property's market-readiness

The result: your agents only take listing appointments with sellers who are qualified, motivated, and realistic about pricing. The AI handles the initial conversation, scores the lead, and hands off to a human with a complete qualification summary.

This runs alongside Lead and Buyer bots in a unified system. The handoff between bots preserves all context -- if a seller also wants to buy, the transition to the Buyer Bot is seamless.

Production stats:
- Zero context loss during handoffs
- 88.1% cache hit rate (keeps costs low)
- 8,500+ tests -- production-grade reliability

Would a **15-minute demo** of the seller qualification flow be useful? I can show you exactly what the agent sees when they get a handoff.
