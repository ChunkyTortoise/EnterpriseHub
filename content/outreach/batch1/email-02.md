Hi {{first_name}},

Luxury buyers have zero patience for generic auto-replies. They expect the same white-glove experience from your digital touchpoints that they get in person. Most real estate chatbots fail this test immediately -- they feel robotic, ask redundant questions, and treat a $3M buyer the same as a $300K one.

I built something different.

The system I developed for a real estate operation uses AI that adapts its tone, depth, and qualification approach based on the buyer's signals. A buyer mentioning "investment property portfolio" gets a different conversation flow than someone asking about school districts. The AI identifies intent, scores readiness, and routes to the right human agent -- all within 60 seconds.

For a luxury brokerage like {{company}}, this means:

- **Instant response** to after-hours inquiries (when 40% of luxury leads come in)
- **Intelligent qualification** that respects the buyer's sophistication level
- **Seamless handoff** to your agents with full conversation context -- no "can you repeat your budget?"
- **Temperature tagging** so your top producers only handle pre-qualified, high-intent leads

The underlying system has 8,500+ automated tests and manages a $50M+ pipeline in production. It's not a prototype -- it's infrastructure.

I'd love to show you a **15-minute demo** tailored to luxury workflows. If it doesn't fit {{company}}'s model, you'll know within 5 minutes.

Open to a quick look?

Best,
