**Subject Line A**: Your CRM has the data. It's missing the intelligence layer.
**Subject Line B**: AI lead scoring that actually talks to your CRM

**Body**:

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company}} is using {{crm_name}} for your operations. Great foundation -- but I'm guessing your lead scoring is still rule-based? If a lead has "pre-approved" in their notes, they get a higher score. If they mention a budget, someone manually updates a field.

The problem: rule-based scoring can't read between the lines. When a lead says "my lease ends in March," that's a strong timeline signal. When they ask about school districts, that's a family-buyer indicator. Rules miss these. AI catches them.

I built an AI qualification layer that integrates directly with CRM systems -- including HubSpot and Salesforce. Here's what it does that your current scoring doesn't:

- **Natural language analysis**: Reads conversation transcripts and extracts intent signals, not just keywords
- **Multi-dimensional scoring**: 10 qualification factors scored simultaneously
- **Automatic tag updates**: Hot/Warm/Cold tags push to {{crm_name}} in real-time via API
- **Cross-bot handoffs**: When a lead needs a buyer specialist or listing consultation, the transition happens with full context

I've built adapters for GoHighLevel, HubSpot, and Salesforce -- all through a unified protocol. Adding your CRM integration is a known quantity, not a research project.

Production numbers:
- 88.1% cache hit rate across the caching layer
- 89% reduction in LLM API costs
- 8,500+ automated tests in the platform

Would a **15-minute walkthrough** of the {{crm_name}} integration be useful? I can show you exactly how the AI layer sits on top of your existing CRM setup.

Best,
