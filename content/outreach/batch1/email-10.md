**Subject Line A**: Before you sign with an AI vendor, read this
**Subject Line B**: What to ask AI vendors that most brokerages don't

**Body**:

Hi {{first_name}},

I saw signals that {{company}} is evaluating AI solutions for your operations. Before you sign anything, here are five questions most brokerages don't ask -- and should:

**1. "How many automated tests does your platform have?"**
If the answer is "we don't share that" or a vague number, the platform was built fast and shipped untested. My system has 8,500+ tests across 11 repositories. That's not a vanity metric -- it's the difference between "works in demos" and "works at 2 AM on a holiday weekend."

**2. "What's your cache hit rate?"**
Every AI query costs money. If the vendor is hitting the LLM API on every interaction, you're overpaying by 40-80%. My system achieves an 88.1% cache hit rate through 3-tier caching, which translates to 89% lower AI costs.

**3. "What happens during a bot-to-bot handoff?"**
If qualification data gets dropped when a lead moves between conversation stages, your agents are re-asking questions and losing leads. My system preserves full context across handoffs with confidence thresholds and circular prevention.

**4. "Who owns the data?"**
Some vendors lock your conversation data in their platform. If you leave, your lead intelligence leaves too. Make sure you own your data.

**5. "Can I see P50/P95/P99 latency benchmarks?"**
"It's fast" isn't an answer. My benchmarks: orchestration P99 at 0.012ms. Lead qualification P95 at 1,225ms. Every number is reproducible with a published benchmark suite.

I'm not pitching against specific vendors. I'm offering a **free 20-minute vendor evaluation consultation** where I help you build a technical scorecard for comparing AI solutions. You'll know exactly what to ask in every vendor demo.

No strings. If my system fits your needs, great. If a competitor fits better, I'll tell you that too.

Worth 20 minutes?

Best,
