**Body**:

Hi {{first_name}},

Investor leads are fundamentally different from residential buyers. They care about cap rates, not school districts. They evaluate cash-on-cash return, not curb appeal. They're buying a spreadsheet, not a home.

But most real estate AI treats every lead the same. Generic qualification scripts that ask about "your dream home" when the lead is looking at a 12-unit multifamily.

I built an AI qualification system with specialized conversation paths:

- **Intent detection**: Identifies investor signals in the first 2-3 messages (portfolio mentions, ROI language, 1031 exchange references)
- **Investment-specific qualification**: Budget range, target asset class, hold strategy (flip vs. hold), financing structure, portfolio size
- **Multi-dimensional scoring**: Readiness assessed on financial capacity, timeline urgency, market knowledge, and deal sophistication
- **Smart routing**: Investor leads go directly to your investment-focused agents with a complete profile -- not to a residential buyer's agent who doesn't speak the language

The system runs on a multi-LLM architecture. Claude handles the deep qualification (best at nuanced intent detection). Gemini handles the fast triage. The routing decision happens in under 50ms.

Currently managing a $50M+ pipeline with:
- 88.1% cache hit rate
- 89% cost reduction on AI API calls
- Full CRM integration (auto-tagging, workflow triggers)

If {{company}} has investor clients, I'd love to show you a **15-minute walkthrough** of how the investor qualification path works. It's a different demo than what I show residential teams.

Worth a quick look?

Best,
