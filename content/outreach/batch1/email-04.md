**Body**:

Hi {{first_name}},

Expanding into new markets usually means hiring more ISAs or overloading your existing team with leads they don't know how to qualify. Different markets mean different price points, different buyer profiles, and different urgency signals. A $400K lead in one market is a hot prospect. In another, it's a tire-kicker.

I built an AI qualification system that adapts to market context automatically:

- **Market-aware scoring**: The system adjusts qualification thresholds based on local median prices, days on market, and inventory levels
- **Multi-dimensional qualification**: 10 factors including budget, timeline, pre-approval, motivation, and property type -- scored per market
- **Automated temperature tagging**: Hot/Warm/Cold labels push to your CRM instantly with tag-based workflow triggers
- **Specialized bot handoffs**: Lead qualification, buyer deep-dive, and seller CMA consultations each handled by purpose-built AI

The system runs on a $50M+ pipeline today with:
- 88.1% cache hit rate (3-tier: in-memory + Redis + PostgreSQL)
- 89% reduction in LLM API costs
- Zero context loss during bot-to-bot transitions
- 8,500+ automated tests across the platform

For {{company}}, this could mean consistent lead qualification across all your markets without adding ISA headcount.

I'd love to do a **20-minute demo** showing how the system adapts to different market contexts. If it doesn't fit your expansion model, you'll know fast.

Worth a look?

Best,
