Hi {{first_name}},

The big franchises are spending millions on AI-powered lead qualification and routing. KW has its Command platform. Compass has their proprietary AI. Realogy has been investing in automation for years.

As an independent brokerage, you can't match that R&D spend. But you can deploy the same capabilities for a fraction of the cost.

I built an AI lead qualification and routing system that's currently managing a $50M+ pipeline. It does what the franchise platforms do:

- **Instant lead qualification** across 10 dimensions (budget, timeline, pre-approval, motivation, property type, and more)
- **Intelligent routing** to the right agent based on lead temperature and specialization
- **24/7 operation** -- handles after-hours and weekend inquiries when 40% of leads come in
- **CRM integration** that auto-updates contact records with qualification data

But unlike the franchise solutions, this system:
- Runs on **your infrastructure** -- you own the data and the platform
- Costs **89% less** in ongoing AI API costs through intelligent 3-tier caching
- Is backed by **8,500+ automated tests** -- production-grade reliability
- Integrates with **GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce** -- whatever you're already using

For an independent brokerage with 10-30 agents, this replaces 1-2 full-time ISAs at a fraction of the salary cost.

I'd love to do a **free 15-minute assessment** of your current lead flow and show you where AI could plug in. No pitch, just specifics.

Interested?
