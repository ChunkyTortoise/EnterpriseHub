# Prospect: Vectara

**Segment**: SaaS CTO | **Template**: Template 3
**Priority**: Batch 1, Week 1

---

## Company Research

Vectara is a RAG-as-a-Service platform founded in 2020 by Amr Awadallah (CEO), Tallat M Shafaat (Chief Architect), and Amin Ahmad. Headquartered in Palo Alto, CA. Raised $73.5M in total funding (Series A led by FPV Ventures and Race Capital). Founded by former Google engineers. The platform provides enterprise RAG with anti-hallucination features, access control, real-time updatability, and can be deployed on-prem, in VPC, or as SaaS.

## Why They're a Fit

Vectara is literally in the RAG business. While they build RAG as a service, they still need production-grade infrastructure, testing, and cost optimization for their own platform. As a competitor/complementary player, there's potential for partnership, consulting, or architecture review. Their focus on reducing hallucination aligns with the citation faithfulness work in the DocQA Engine.

## Personalization Hooks

- Founded by ex-Google engineers -- high engineering standards
- RAG-as-a-Service means they understand the domain deeply
- Anti-hallucination focus aligns with citation faithfulness metrics
- $73.5M raised -- need to demonstrate efficiency to investors

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Fractional AI CTO -- $150/hr vs $250K/yr hire

Hi Amr,

Vectara's RAG-as-a-Service approach is the right abstraction layer for enterprise AI. You've identified the exact gap: most companies can't build production RAG in-house.

I've been building production RAG systems independently and have some complementary expertise that might be useful:

- **Multi-LLM orchestration** with Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini (fallback chains, cost routing)
- **3-tier caching** achieving 88% hit rate and 89% cost reduction
- **CRM integration patterns** (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce) -- a layer above the RAG pipeline
- **8,500+ tests** across 11 production repos (BM25 + semantic search + re-ranking)

I'm positioned as a fractional AI CTO -- helping companies that use platforms like Vectara but need custom orchestration, CRM integration, and application-layer engineering on top.

Could be a referral partnership opportunity: you handle the RAG infrastructure, I handle the application layer. Worth a 30-minute exploration?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Fractional AI CTO -- $150/hr vs $250K/yr hire

Hi Amr,

Quick follow-up. Another angle: your enterprise customers likely need help building application layers on top of Vectara's RAG infrastructure. Custom chatbots, CRM integrations, dashboard analytics.

I could serve as a recommended implementation partner for customers who need production-grade application engineering above the RAG layer. My $2,500 Architecture Audit would be a natural entry point.

Worth discussing?

Cayman

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: RAG application layer architecture

I documented the full application architecture I've built on top of RAG pipelines (multi-agent orchestration, CRM integration, BI dashboards). Happy to share -- reply "send it."

### Connection Request

Hi Amr -- I build production applications on top of RAG pipelines (11 repos, 8,500+ tests, 89% cost reduction). Vectara's RAG-as-a-Service is impressive. There might be a partnership opportunity. Would love to connect.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting, Amr. I think there's a natural partnership: Vectara handles RAG infrastructure, I handle the application layer (multi-agent orchestration, CRM integration, dashboards). Your enterprise customers often need both. Worth a 30-minute conversation?
