## Company Research

Luxury Presence is an AI marketing platform for real estate agents founded by Malte Kramer in 2016, headquartered in Austin, TX. They raised $52M from investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, Spencer Rascoff (Zillow co-founder), and Tom Ferry. $75M+ ARR growing at 34% YoY. Over 65,000 real estate agents and brands use the platform. Recently launched an "Autonomous AI Marketing Team" with AI SEO, AI Ads, and AI Blog specialists.

## Why They're a Fit

Luxury Presence is deploying multiple autonomous AI agents for marketing tasks. Their multi-agent architecture (SEO specialist, Ads specialist, Blog specialist) is exactly the pattern where orchestration, cost optimization, and intelligent routing add massive value. At $75M ARR and 65,000 customers, LLM costs at scale are a strategic concern.

## Personalization Hooks

- "Fully Autonomous AI Marketing Team" launch shows commitment to agentic AI
- $75M ARR at 34% growth means scaling costs matter
- Multi-agent architecture (SEO, Ads, Blog) needs orchestration
- Malte is focused on AI search shift as next competitive advantage
- Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff as investor adds credibility

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your AI pipeline is costing you 40-80% more than it should

Hi Malte,

Congrats on hitting $75M ARR with Luxury Presence. The Autonomous AI Marketing Team launch is exactly where real estate AI is heading -- multi-agent, always-on, fully automated.

Here's a thought: with three AI specialists (SEO, Ads, Blog) running autonomously for 65,000+ agents, LLM orchestration costs scale fast. I built a multi-agent orchestration system for real estate that solved this:

- **89% LLM cost reduction** via 3-tier caching (88% hit rate)
- **P99: 0.095ms** for multi-agent coordination
- **4.3M agent dispatches/sec** throughput on a separate orchestration engine

At Luxury Presence's scale, optimizing the orchestration layer between your AI specialists could save significant LLM costs while maintaining quality.

I'd love to do a 15-minute walkthrough of the orchestration architecture. Worth a quick look?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your AI pipeline is costing you 40-80% more than it should

Hi Malte,

Quick follow-up. For multi-agent systems like Luxury Presence's AI team, the biggest cost driver is usually redundant LLM calls between agents. My caching layer detects when different agents are asking similar questions about the same data and serves cached results instead.

At 65,000 agents generating content, the overlap in queries (local market data, neighborhood descriptions, listing details) is high. That's where the 88% hit rate comes from.

15 minutes to discuss?

Cayman

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: Multi-agent AI cost optimization brief

Hi Malte,

I documented the orchestration architecture that handles 4.3M agent dispatches/sec with sub-millisecond coordination. Happy to share -- just reply "send it."
