## Company Research

Squirro is a Swiss-headquartered enterprise AI platform specializing in RAG-powered search and insights for finance, insurance, and government sectors. They provide enterprise-grade RAG with a focus on bridging knowledge and generative AI. The company has been publishing thought leadership on "RAG in 2026" and positions itself as a leader in enterprise knowledge augmentation. They serve regulated industries where accuracy, compliance, and data governance are non-negotiable.

## Why They're a Fit

Squirro serves regulated industries (finance, insurance, government) where compliance, accuracy, and cost control are paramount. Their RAG focus means they understand the technology deeply, and their enterprise customers likely need custom application layers, CRM integrations, and multi-agent orchestration on top of the RAG pipeline. The regulated industry focus aligns with the security and compliance architecture in EnterpriseHub.

## Personalization Hooks

- Regulated industry focus (finance, insurance, government) demands compliance expertise
- Publishing "RAG in 2026" thought leadership shows domain authority

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Fractional AI CTO -- $150/hr vs $250K/yr hire

Hi team,

Squirro's focus on RAG for regulated industries is a smart positioning choice. Finance, insurance, and government customers need AI that's accurate, compliant, and auditable -- not just fast.

I built production AI systems with the same priorities:
- **89% LLM cost reduction** while maintaining accuracy (citation faithfulness: 0.88)
- **Compliance-first architecture** (CCPA, encrypted PII, JWT auth, full audit trails)
- **P50/P95/P99 benchmarking** with configurable alert rules
- **8,500+ automated tests** across 11 production repos

For Squirro's enterprise customers in regulated industries, the application layer above the RAG pipeline (CRM integration, multi-agent orchestration, workflow automation) is where I add value. I could serve as a recommended implementation partner for customers who need production-grade applications on top of Squirro's platform.

Worth a 30-minute conversation?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Fractional AI CTO -- $150/hr vs $250K/yr hire

Quick follow-up. For regulated industries, the compliance architecture is often the make-or-break:

My system handles PII encryption (Fernet at rest), JWT auth (1hr tokens, 100 req/min rate limiting), and full audit trails for every AI interaction. For finance and insurance, this kind of infrastructure is table stakes.

15 minutes to discuss a partnership model?

**Subject**: Compliance-first AI architecture for regulated industries
