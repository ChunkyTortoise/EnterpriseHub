# Prospect: Lofty (formerly Chime)

**Segment**: PropTech Founder | **Template**: Template 2
**Priority**: Batch 2, Week 2

## Company Research

Lofty (formerly Chime Technologies) is an all-in-one real estate CRM platform headquartered in Phoenix, AZ. Founded in 2012 by Matthew Murphy, now led by CEO Joe Chen since 2018. They offer AI-powered lead generation, CRM, marketing, and an "AI Workforce" with intelligent automation, predictive insights, and virtual assistant capabilities. Rebranded from Chime to Lofty in November 2023 to reflect their expanded AI vision.

## Why They're a Fit

Lofty's "AI Workforce" concept is directly comparable to the multi-agent architecture in EnterpriseHub. Their predictive insights and virtual assistant features could benefit from better orchestration, caching, and multi-model routing. The rebrand signals they're investing heavily in AI differentiation.

## Personalization Hooks

- Rebrand from Chime to Lofty signals AI-first strategic direction
- "AI Workforce" language aligns with multi-agent orchestration
- Joe Chen's quote about "AI-driven world" shows vision alignment
- Predictive insights suggest they're working with ML pipelines

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your lead qualification is slower than your competitors'

Hi Joe,

The rebrand from Chime to Lofty makes sense -- the AI Workforce concept is where real estate tech is heading. Multi-agent, predictive, always-on.

I built something similar for a real estate platform: three specialized AI agents (Lead, Buyer, Seller) coordinated through an orchestration layer. But the key insight wasn't the agents themselves -- it was the infrastructure:

- **3-tier caching** that reduced LLM costs by 89% (88% cache hit rate)
- **Sub-200ms orchestration** for multi-agent coordination
- **Learned handoff thresholds** that improve accuracy over time

For Lofty's AI Workforce, this kind of infrastructure could mean: faster responses, lower per-conversation costs, and smarter agent-to-agent handoffs as your system scales.

I've got a 15-minute demo of the orchestration architecture. Worth a quick look?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your lead qualification is slower than your competitors'

Hi Joe,

Follow-up with a specific example: Lofty's predictive insights feature likely generates similar queries across thousands of agents. My caching layer detects this overlap and serves cached results for common patterns, while only hitting the LLM for novel queries.

At Lofty's scale, this pattern could reduce AI infrastructure costs by 40-80%.

15 minutes to discuss?

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: AI Workforce architecture resource

I documented the orchestration architecture for multi-agent real estate AI systems. Happy to share -- just reply "send it."

## LinkedIn Messages

### Connection Request

Hi Joe -- I build multi-agent AI orchestration systems for real estate. Lofty's "AI Workforce" concept aligns closely with what I've built (89% cost reduction, sub-200ms orchestration). Would love to connect.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting, Joe. Lofty's AI Workforce and my multi-agent orchestration system share the same vision. The difference is infrastructure: 3-tier caching (88% hit rate), learned handoff thresholds, and multi-model routing. Could reduce your AI costs significantly. Open to a 15-minute architecture walkthrough?
