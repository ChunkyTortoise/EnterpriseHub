# Prospect: Glean

**Segment**: SaaS CTO | **Template**: Template 3
**Priority**: Batch 1, Week 1

---

## Company Research

Glean is an enterprise AI search platform founded by Arvind Jain (CEO) in 2019, headquartered in Palo Alto, CA. Arvind spent over a decade at Google as a distinguished engineer (Search, Maps, YouTube) and co-founded Rubrik ($4B+ data security company). Raised $765M across 6 rounds, valued at $7.2B (as of June 2025). Glean connects company knowledge across tools to deliver trusted, cited answers using RAG. Series F completed.

## Why They're a Fit

Glean is one of the largest RAG-powered companies in the world. At $7.2B valuation, they're operating at massive scale. While they likely have strong internal engineering, the fractional CTO positioning would be more relevant as a referral/partnership play -- or architecture consulting for their enterprise customers who need custom application layers on top of Glean.

## Personalization Hooks

- Arvind's Google Search background means extremely high engineering bar
- $7.2B valuation and $765M raised -- massive scale
- RAG is core to their product -- they live and breathe retrieval
- Enterprise AI search means they serve customers who also need AI consulting

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Fractional AI CTO -- $150/hr vs $250K/yr hire

Hi Arvind,

Glean has essentially defined the enterprise AI search category. What I find interesting is the layer above Glean in your customers' stacks -- the custom applications, CRM integrations, and workflow automation that sit on top of enterprise search.

I'm a fractional AI CTO who builds those application layers:

- **Multi-LLM orchestration** with 89% cost reduction via 3-tier caching
- **CRM integrations** (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce) with AI-powered lead scoring
- **Multi-agent systems** with confidence-scored handoffs and zero context loss
- **8,500+ automated tests** across 11 production repos

Your enterprise customers likely need this kind of application engineering on top of Glean's search infrastructure. I could be a recommended implementation partner or consulting resource.

Worth a 30-minute conversation about whether there's a fit?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Fractional AI CTO -- $150/hr vs $250K/yr hire

Hi Arvind,

Quick follow-up. The specific gap I see in the enterprise AI stack:

Glean answers "what does our company know?" beautifully. But customers also need: "take that knowledge and act on it" -- qualify leads, route support tickets, trigger CRM workflows, generate reports.

That application layer is what I build. Partnership could look like: Glean customer signs up, needs custom workflow integration, you refer them to me for implementation.

Worth exploring?

Cayman

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: Enterprise AI application layer architecture

I documented the full application architecture I build on top of RAG platforms (orchestration, CRM integration, multi-agent systems). Happy to share -- reply "send it."

### Connection Request

Hi Arvind -- I build application layers on top of enterprise RAG platforms (multi-agent orchestration, CRM integration, 89% cost reduction). Your customers likely need this kind of implementation support. Would love to connect.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting, Arvind. I think there's a natural partnership opportunity: Glean handles enterprise search, I handle the application layer (workflow automation, CRM integration, multi-agent systems). Your enterprise customers often need both. Worth a quick conversation?
