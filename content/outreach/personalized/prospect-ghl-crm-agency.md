### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: How we cut a GHL agency's AI costs by 89%

Hi there,

I noticed GoHighLevel CRM Agency focuses on helping businesses scale with GHL. Here's something I've seen consistently: as GHL deployments scale, AI costs and bot performance become the biggest bottlenecks.

I built a solution:

- **3-tier Redis caching** that reduces LLM API costs by 89%
- **Intelligent bot handoffs** with zero context loss (conversation history, qualification data preserved)
- **Automatic lead scoring** with Hot/Warm/Cold tag routing into GHL workflows

The system manages a $50M+ pipeline in production with 5,100+ automated tests.

I'd love to do a free 15-minute audit of one of your client GHL setups -- just specifics on cost optimization and handoff improvements.

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: How we cut a GHL agency's AI costs by 89%

Quick follow-up. The scaling challenge with GHL AI bots usually hits around 500-1,000 conversations/month -- that's when API costs start climbing fast. My caching layer keeps those costs flat because 88% of queries never touch the API.

15 minutes to walk through the architecture?
