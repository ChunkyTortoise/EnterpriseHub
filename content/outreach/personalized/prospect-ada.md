# Prospect: Ada

**Segment**: SaaS CTO | **Template**: Template 3
**Priority**: Batch 2, Week 2

## Company Research

Ada is an enterprise AI customer service platform founded in 2016 by Mike Murchison (CEO) and David Hariri, headquartered in Toronto, Canada. Raised $200M in total funding (Series C at $130M pushed valuation above $1B -- unicorn status). Backed by Bessemer Venture Partners, FirstMark Capital, and Accel. Their "Reasoning Engine" powers an AI agent that resolves customer inquiries, answers questions, and upsells. No-code platform for building customer service chatbots.

## Why They're a Fit

Ada's Reasoning Engine is doing exactly what the Jorge Bot orchestration does -- understanding intent, routing conversations, and managing handoffs. As a unicorn with $200M raised, they're under investor pressure to demonstrate efficiency. Their no-code platform means they're abstracting complexity -- but the underlying AI orchestration still needs optimization. Customer service queries are highly repetitive and cacheable.

## Personalization Hooks

- Unicorn status ($1B+ valuation) means investor scrutiny on unit economics
- "Reasoning Engine" is architecturally similar to multi-agent orchestration
- No-code platform means customers don't see the AI infrastructure -- but it needs to be efficient
- Mike's UofT background (Toronto AI ecosystem) shows engineering depth
- AI that upsells (not just answers) is a sophisticated use case

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your AI pipeline is costing you 40-80% more than it should

Hi Mike,

Ada's Reasoning Engine is impressive -- an AI agent that resolves, answers, AND upsells is a hard problem. Most chatbots can barely handle one of those three.

Here's something that might be relevant at unicorn scale: customer service queries are among the most cacheable AI workloads. "Where's my order?" gets asked millions of times across your customer base with minor variations.

I built a multi-agent AI system with:
- **88% cache hit rate** via 3-tier caching (semantic layer catches paraphrased queries)
- **89% LLM cost reduction** -- directly improves unit economics
- **Confidence-scored handoffs** between specialized agents with zero context loss

At Ada's scale ($1B+ valuation, $200M raised), improving LLM cost efficiency by even 20-30% moves the needle on unit economics in a way investors notice.

My $2,500 Architecture Audit is a scored assessment across six dimensions. Most identify $5K-$15K/month in savings.

Worth a 30-minute discovery call?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your AI pipeline is costing you 40-80% more than it should

Hi Mike,

Quick follow-up. The upsell capability in Ada's Reasoning Engine is particularly interesting from an orchestration perspective.

In my system, I use separate specialized agents for different intents (qualification, support, and conversion) with confidence-scored handoffs between them. The conversion agent only receives a lead after the qualification agent confirms readiness. This prevents premature upsell attempts while ensuring high-intent signals get priority.

The same pattern could optimize Ada's upsell timing.

15 minutes to discuss?

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: Multi-agent orchestration for customer service AI

I documented the architecture for confidence-scored handoffs between specialized AI agents. Directly relevant to reasoning engines. Reply "send it" if useful.

### Connection Request

Hi Mike -- I build multi-agent AI orchestration systems (89% cost reduction, confidence-scored handoffs). Ada's Reasoning Engine architecture is impressive. Would love to connect and compare approaches.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting, Mike. Ada's Reasoning Engine and my multi-agent orchestration share the same patterns. My 3-tier caching (88% hit rate) is particularly relevant for customer service queries. At unicorn scale, LLM cost efficiency directly impacts unit economics. Open to a 30-minute architecture discussion?
