# Prospect: E2M Solutions

**Segment**: GHL Agency Owner | **Template**: Template 1

## Company Research

E2M Solutions is a white-label digital agency founded by Manish Dudharejia, serving 400+ digital agencies across the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, France, and Australia. They offer white-label GHL development, website design, SEO, PPC, and recently added Fractional AI Consulting and AI Automation Services. They merged with UnlimitedWP (founded by Ronik Patel) and have a CEO named Brent who handles strategic vision.

## Why They're a Fit

E2M already offers AI consulting and automation services, and they handle GHL development for hundreds of agencies. They need production-grade AI systems (not prototypes) to serve their enterprise clients. With 400+ agency clients, even a small per-client cost optimization would translate to massive aggregate savings.

## Personalization Hooks

- Manish has been featured on podcasts discussing high-performance team building
- They recently added "Fractional AI Consulting" to their service lineup -- direct overlap
- 13 years in operation, serving 400+ agencies
- Merger with UnlimitedWP shows growth ambitions

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your GHL setup is leaving money on the table

Hi Manish,

I saw E2M recently added Fractional AI Consulting and AI Automation to your service lineup. Smart move -- your 400+ agency clients are going to need this.

Here's something that might accelerate that offering: I built an AI orchestration layer for GoHighLevel that achieved 89% LLM cost reduction through a 3-tier Redis caching strategy. The system handles multi-bot handoffs with zero context loss and manages a $50M+ pipeline.

For an agency like E2M serving hundreds of GHL clients, this architecture could become a premium service tier. Each client saves $3,000+/month on AI costs, and you capture a portion as recurring revenue.

I'd love to do a free mini-audit of one of your GHL client setups. 15 minutes, no pitch -- just specifics on where AI costs are leaking and where handoffs are dropping leads.

Worth a quick conversation?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your GHL setup is leaving money on the table

Hi Manish,

Quick follow-up. I know E2M is scaling its AI consulting practice, so here's a concrete number:

The 3-tier caching system I built hits an 88% cache hit rate. For a client running 1,000 AI-powered conversations/month, that means 880 of them never touch the LLM API. At $0.03/query, that's $26/month saved per client. Multiply across 400+ agency clients and you're looking at $100K+/year in aggregate savings.

Happy to walk through the architecture in 15 minutes if the math interests you.

Cayman

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: GHL AI optimization resource

Hi Manish,

Last note. I put together a brief on the 3 highest-ROI AI optimizations for GHL agencies (caching layers, handoff orchestration, and LLM cost routing). Takes 5 minutes to read.

Reply "send it" if you'd like a copy. No call needed.

### Connection Request

Hi Manish -- I build production AI systems for GHL agencies. Saw E2M's new AI consulting offering and thought there might be synergy. 89% LLM cost reduction on my last GHL project. Would love to connect.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting, Manish. Congrats on adding AI consulting to E2M's lineup. I recently built a multi-bot orchestration system on GHL that cut LLM costs by 89% and eliminated context loss during handoffs. Might be a strong addition to your service catalog. Open to a 15-minute call to explore?
