### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: How we cut a GHL agency's AI costs by 89%

Hi team,

I came across Dean Infotech's enterprise GHL work -- especially the real estate and medical verticals. That level of CRM architecture is rare in the GHL space.

I have a case study that's directly relevant: I built an AI orchestration system on GHL for a real estate operation that manages a $50M+ pipeline. Three specialized bots handle Lead, Buyer, and Seller conversations with intelligent handoffs, and the whole thing runs on a 3-tier caching layer.

Key metrics:
- **89% LLM cost reduction** (critical for enterprise-scale deployments)
- **Zero context loss** during bot-to-bot transitions
- **CCPA/Fair Housing compliant** with encrypted PII handling

For enterprise clients in real estate and medical, this kind of production-grade AI integration is a major differentiator. I'd love to explore how Dean Infotech could offer this as a premium service tier.

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: How we cut a GHL agency's AI costs by 89%

Quick follow-up. For your enterprise clients, the compliance piece is often the blocker for AI adoption:

My system handles PII encryption (Fernet at rest), JWT auth with rate limiting, and full audit trails. For medical clients, this kind of infrastructure is non-negotiable. For real estate, DRE and Fair Housing compliance is baked in.

Happy to walk through the security architecture in 15 minutes.
