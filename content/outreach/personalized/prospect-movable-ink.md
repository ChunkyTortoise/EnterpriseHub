# Prospect: Movable Ink

**Segment**: SaaS CTO | **Template**: Template 3
**Priority**: Batch 2, Week 2

---

## Company Research

Movable Ink is an AI-powered marketing personalization platform co-founded by Vivek Sharma (CEO), headquartered in New York City. One of the fastest-growing SaaS companies in the US. Personalizes every customer engagement through automation and AI. In June 2025, signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by STG (PE firm). Vivek remains as CEO. Recently unveiled "Autonomous Marketing Capabilities" -- AI agents for marketing personalization at scale.

## Why They're a Fit

Movable Ink's "Autonomous Marketing Capabilities" means they're deploying AI agents for marketing tasks -- the same multi-agent pattern. PE acquisition by STG means efficiency and cost optimization are top priorities. Their marketing personalization at scale creates massive LLM volume that benefits from caching and cost optimization.

## Personalization Hooks

- STG acquisition means PE-driven efficiency focus
- "Autonomous Marketing Capabilities" = multi-agent AI architecture
- Vivek staying as CEO post-acquisition shows commitment
- Marketing personalization at scale = high LLM volume = high caching opportunity
- "Fastest-growing SaaS" means infrastructure must keep pace

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your AI pipeline is costing you 40-80% more than it should

Hi Vivek,

Congrats on the STG partnership. The Autonomous Marketing Capabilities launch is exciting -- AI agents for personalization at scale is the right direction.

Under PE ownership, AI cost efficiency becomes a board-level metric. Marketing personalization generates enormous LLM volume, and most of those queries follow repeatable patterns (similar customer segments, similar product recommendations).

I built a multi-agent AI system with:
- **88% cache hit rate** on LLM queries via 3-tier caching
- **89% cost reduction** on LLM operations ($3,600/mo to $400/mo on one deployment)
- **4.3M agent dispatches/sec** throughput on the orchestration engine

For Movable Ink's scale, even a 30-40% optimization on the AI infrastructure layer materially impacts margins -- exactly what STG cares about.

My $2,500 Architecture Audit delivers a scored assessment with specific cost reduction projections. Most identify $5K-$15K/month in savings.

Worth a 30-minute discovery call?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your AI pipeline is costing you 40-80% more than it should

Hi Vivek,

Quick follow-up. Marketing personalization has a unique caching advantage: customer segments share similar characteristics, so AI responses for "female, 25-34, interested in outdoor gear" can be cached and reused across many customers in that segment.

My semantic caching layer detects this overlap and serves cached results. At Movable Ink's volume, the savings compound quickly.

15 minutes to discuss?

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: AI cost optimization for marketing personalization

I documented the caching architecture for high-volume AI personalization workloads. Reply "send it" if useful.

### Connection Request

Hi Vivek -- I build AI orchestration systems for high-volume personalization (89% cost reduction, 4.3M dispatches/sec). Movable Ink's Autonomous Marketing Capabilities are the right direction. Would love to connect.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting, Vivek. Under PE ownership, AI cost efficiency is critical. My 3-tier caching (88% hit rate) and multi-agent orchestration could significantly reduce Movable Ink's AI infrastructure costs. $2,500 Architecture Audit identifies specific savings. Open to a quick chat?
