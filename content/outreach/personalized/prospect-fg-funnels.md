## Company Research

FG Funnels is built on the GoHighLevel framework and caters to course creators, coaches, and digital entrepreneurs. They combine GHL's automation power with visually stunning funnel templates and membership site designs. Their focus is on funnel-based businesses -- landing pages, sales funnels, lead generation, and membership sites.

## Why They're a Fit

Course creators and coaches generate high volumes of leads through funnels that need intelligent qualification. FG Funnels' clients need to quickly distinguish between tire-kickers and ready-to-buy prospects. An AI qualification layer would increase conversion rates from their funnels and reduce the manual follow-up burden on their coaching clients.

## Personalization Hooks

- Course creators and coaches are perfect AI chatbot candidates
- High funnel volume means high lead volume that needs intelligent filtering
- Membership site integration creates opportunities for AI-powered onboarding
- Funnel-first approach means they understand conversion optimization

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your GHL setup is leaving money on the table

Hi team,

FG Funnels' approach to combining gorgeous design with GHL automation for course creators is smart. But here's the gap I see in most funnel-to-GHL setups:

A lead enters a beautifully designed funnel, fills out a form, and then... gets a generic autoresponder. The qualification happens manually, days later.

I built a system that qualifies leads in real-time the moment they enter GHL:

- **Instant intent detection** -- buying, browsing, or just curious
- **89% lower AI costs** than standard chatbot setups
- **Automatic Hot/Warm/Cold routing** to the right nurture sequence

For course creators, this means the leads most likely to enroll get priority attention within seconds, not days. The rest get automated nurture sequences matched to their intent.

Worth a 15-minute conversation about adding this to FG Funnels' offering?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your GHL setup is leaving money on the table

Quick follow-up. Course creators using FG Funnels typically have 2 types of leads: ready-to-enroll and needs-nurturing. My system separates them automatically using multi-LLM scoring and routes each to the right workflow.

The caching layer means this works at scale without blowing up API costs. 15 minutes to discuss?

**Subject**: Funnel + AI qualification resource
