### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: How we cut a GHL agency's AI costs by 89%

Hi there,

I noticed The GHL Partner handles SaaS mode implementation and white-label CRM setups. That's the kind of platform-level work that benefits most from intelligent AI automation.

I built an AI orchestration system for a GHL deployment that takes the CRM integration to another level:

- **89% LLM cost reduction** via a 3-tier Redis caching layer
- **Intelligent lead routing** -- Hot/Warm/Cold tags applied automatically based on AI scoring
- **Cross-bot handoffs** with full context preservation (budget, timeline, conversation history)

For SaaS mode resellers, this kind of AI layer could be a significant differentiator -- and a premium pricing tier.

I'm offering free 15-minute GHL audits this month. Worth a quick look at one of your setups?

Quick follow-up. For SaaS mode resellers, here's the pitch to end clients:

"Your CRM doesn't just capture leads -- it qualifies them instantly, routes them to the right team, and optimizes AI costs automatically." That's what my orchestration layer enables on top of GHL.

15 minutes to explore?
