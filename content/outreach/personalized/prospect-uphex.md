# Prospect: UpHex

**Segment**: GHL Agency Owner | **Template**: Template 1
**Priority**: Batch 1, Week 1

## Company Research

UpHex is a GHL-integrated ad automation platform co-founded by Sam Carlson. It enables agencies to launch Facebook, Instagram, Google, and YouTube ad campaigns directly from the GHL dashboard in 3 clicks. Sam's background is running his own digital marketing agency, which led him to build UpHex to solve ad management pain points. The platform focuses on white-label ad automation for GHL agencies.

## Why They're a Fit

UpHex is already deeply integrated with GHL and handles ad automation at scale. Their next frontier is likely AI-powered ad optimization, lead qualification from ad responses, and intelligent follow-up sequences. A production-grade AI orchestration layer could power smarter lead routing from their ad campaigns into GHL workflows.

## Personalization Hooks

- Sam built UpHex from his own agency pain points -- understands operator frustration
- 3-click ad launch is impressive but leads still need intelligent follow-up
- The gap between ad click and lead qualification is where AI orchestration adds value
- Featured on Medium as "revolutionizing Facebook Ads with GoHighLevel for SaaS"

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: What happens after the 3-click ad launch?

Hi Sam,

Love what UpHex is doing with ad automation on GHL. Getting agencies from "I need to run ads" to "ads are live" in 3 clicks is a real differentiator.

But here's the gap I keep seeing: the leads that come in from those ads hit a generic GHL workflow and get the same autoresponder regardless of intent. A lead asking about pricing needs a different conversation than someone just browsing.

I built an AI orchestration system on GHL that solves this:

- **Multi-bot routing** based on lead intent (buyer, seller, general inquiry)
- **89% LLM cost reduction** via 3-tier caching
- **Intelligent handoffs** with zero context loss and 0.7 confidence scoring

For UpHex, this could close the loop between "ad clicked" and "lead qualified" -- making your platform even stickier for agencies.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: What happens after the 3-click ad launch?

Hi Sam,

Quick follow-up on the lead qualification piece. Here's a concrete example:

One of my systems takes an inbound lead from a GHL form, scores it across 10 dimensions (budget, timeline, motivation, etc.), and routes it to a specialized bot -- all in under 200ms. The lead gets a personalized response in seconds, not a generic "thanks for reaching out."

The result: Hot leads get immediate attention, Warm leads get nurtured, Cold leads get educational content. All automated via GHL tags.

15 minutes to walk through it?

Cayman

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: UpHex + AI lead qualification

Hi Sam,

Last thought: agencies using UpHex for ad automation + an AI qualification layer would have a complete pipeline -- from ad click to qualified appointment. That's a significant competitive moat.

Happy to share the architecture diagram if you're curious. Just reply "send it."

Thanks for connecting, Sam. I built a system that qualifies GHL leads in under 200ms using multi-LLM orchestration with 89% cost reduction. Could be a natural add-on to UpHex's ad automation -- closing the loop from "ad click" to "qualified lead." Open to a quick chat?
