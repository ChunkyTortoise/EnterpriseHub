## Company Research

Streamline Results is a GoHighLevel Certified Partner agency founded by Jonathan Johnson. They specialize in SEO, PPC, Google Business Listing development, and GHL automation for local businesses. As a certified GHL partner, they're deeply embedded in the GHL ecosystem and likely manage multiple client subaccounts.

## Why They're a Fit

As a certified GHL partner, Jonathan is already invested in the GHL ecosystem. His clients likely use GHL automation for lead capture and follow-up but may not have intelligent AI-powered handoffs or cost-optimized LLM integrations. A free audit positions us as a trusted expert while identifying upsell opportunities.

## Personalization Hooks

- Certified GHL partner status shows commitment to the platform
- Focus on local businesses -- these clients need fast, intelligent lead response
- SEO + PPC background means he understands lead generation and conversion metrics

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your GHL setup is leaving money on the table

Hi Jonathan,

I noticed Streamline Results is a Certified GHL Partner. Respect the commitment to the platform.

Quick question: are your local business clients getting sub-minute AI responses to new leads? Most GHL setups I audit are either too slow (generic autoresponders) or too expensive (every message hitting the LLM API).

I built a system on GHL that does both -- fast AND cheap:

- **89% LLM cost reduction** via 3-tier caching (most queries never hit the API)
- **Sub-200ms orchestration** for bot-to-bot handoffs
- **Hot/Warm/Cold tagging** that triggers the right workflow automatically

For a certified partner like you, this could be a premium service tier for your local business clients. I'd love to do a free 15-minute audit of one of your GHL setups -- just specifics, no pitch.

Interested?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your GHL setup is leaving money on the table

Hi Jonathan,

Following up quickly. One thing I see consistently with GHL certified partners: the bot workflows are solid for single-intent conversations, but break down when a lead shifts from "browsing" to "ready to buy."

The handoff system I built detects that shift with a 0.7 confidence threshold and transfers the conversation to a specialized bot -- with full context (budget, timeline, conversation history). No re-qualification needed.

15 minutes to walk through it?

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: GHL certified partner resource

Hi Jonathan,

Last note. I've got a quick checklist of the 5 GHL automation bottlenecks I see most often with certified partners. Happy to share if useful -- just reply "send it."

Keep crushing it with Streamline Results.
