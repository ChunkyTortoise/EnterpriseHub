# Prospect: Forethought

**Segment**: SaaS CTO | **Template**: Template 3
**Priority**: Batch 1, Week 1

---

## Company Research

Forethought is a multi-agent AI platform for customer support, founded in 2017 by Deon Nicholas, Colm Doyle, and Sami Ghoche. CEO is Sami Ghoche, with Deon Nicholas as Co-founder, President & Executive Chairman. Headquartered in San Francisco, CA. Raised $117M in total funding (Series D) from NEA, K9 Ventures, and Neo. They automate customer support by resolving issues, triaging tickets, assisting agents, and surfacing insights. Integrates with 70+ helpdesks and knowledge sources.

## Why They're a Fit

Forethought's multi-agent approach to customer support is architecturally similar to the EnterpriseHub multi-bot system. They handle ticket triage (scoring), agent handoffs (routing), and knowledge retrieval (RAG). Their 70+ integrations create complex orchestration needs. At Series D, they're focused on efficiency and cost optimization.

## Personalization Hooks

- Multi-agent AI architecture aligns directly with multi-bot orchestration expertise
- 70+ integrations create complex orchestration and caching opportunities
- Series D means efficiency and margin improvement are strategic priorities
- Customer support AI has highly repetitive patterns -- ideal for caching

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your AI pipeline is costing you 40-80% more than it should

Hi Sami,

Forethought's multi-agent approach to customer support is architecturally compelling. Resolving, triaging, assisting, and surfacing insights as separate agents is the right design.

I built a similar multi-agent system (for real estate, not support) with some infrastructure innovations that might be relevant:

- **3-tier caching** that reduced LLM costs by 89% (customer support queries are highly repetitive -- perfect for caching)
- **P99: 0.095ms** for multi-agent coordination
- **Confidence-scored handoffs** between agents with zero context loss

At Series D, LLM cost efficiency is a strategic priority. For a multi-agent system handling thousands of support tickets, even a 30-40% cost reduction on the orchestration layer is material.

I do $2,500 Architecture Audits -- a scored assessment across six categories with specific cost reduction projections and a migration roadmap. Most identify $5K-$15K/month in savings.

Worth a 30-minute discovery call?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your AI pipeline is costing you 40-80% more than it should

Hi Sami,

Follow-up with a specific insight: customer support queries follow predictable patterns. "How do I reset my password?" gets asked thousands of times with slight variations.

My semantic caching layer (L3) detects that "reset my password," "forgot password," and "can't log in" are semantically similar and serves a cached response. At Forethought's volume, this pattern alone could significantly reduce LLM calls.

15 minutes to discuss the architecture?

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: Multi-agent orchestration + caching architecture

I documented the caching architecture that achieves 88% hit rate on multi-agent AI systems. Directly relevant to customer support. Reply "send it" if useful.

### Connection Request

Hi Sami -- I build multi-agent AI orchestration systems (89% cost reduction, P99: 0.095ms). Forethought's multi-agent approach to support is architecturally similar to what I've built. Would love to connect.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting, Sami. Forethought's multi-agent support system and my orchestration architecture share the same patterns. My 3-tier caching (88% hit rate) is particularly relevant for support queries, which are highly repetitive. $2,500 Architecture Audit could identify significant savings at your scale. Open to a quick chat?
