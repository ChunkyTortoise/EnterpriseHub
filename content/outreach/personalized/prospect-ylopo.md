# Prospect: Ylopo

**Segment**: PropTech Founder | **Template**: Template 2
**Priority**: Batch 1, Week 1

---

## Company Research

Ylopo is an AI-first real estate lead generation and nurturing platform co-founded by Howard Tager (CEO) and Juefeng Ge. Howard previously co-founded TigerLead Solutions, pioneering real estate digital marketing. Ylopo offers AI-powered texting (formerly rAIya), AI voice assistants, and cross-platform lead generation via Facebook and Google. Located in Marina del Rey, CA. AI infused into every part of the platform.

## Why They're a Fit

Ylopo is already building AI-powered lead qualification but likely using single-model architectures. Multi-LLM orchestration, intelligent caching, and handoff systems could improve their response quality while reducing costs. Their AI voice assistant could benefit from the same orchestration patterns used in the Jorge Bot system.

## Personalization Hooks

- Howard's background in TigerLead shows deep real estate marketing experience
- 5 years of AI texting development means they've hit production challenges
- AI voice assistant is a complex orchestration problem -- handoffs between voice and text
- Cross-platform lead gen (Facebook + Google) means high lead volume needing qualification

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: 88% cache hit rate on AI lead scoring -- here's how

Hi Howard,

I've been following Ylopo's AI evolution -- from rAIya to the full AI voice assistant. Five years of AI in production is rare in PropTech.

Here's something that might be relevant as you scale: I built a multi-LLM orchestration system for a real estate platform that handles lead qualification across multiple bot personas. The key innovation is a 3-tier caching layer:

- **88% cache hit rate** -- most lead conversations follow similar patterns
- **89% cost reduction** on LLM operations ($3,600/mo to $400/mo)
- **Sub-200ms orchestration** even with multi-model coordination

For Ylopo's AI voice + text platform, this kind of caching could dramatically reduce per-conversation costs while maintaining response quality. The handoff orchestration between voice and text channels is a problem I've solved with confidence-scored routing.

I'd love to show you a 15-minute demo of the qualification flow. Open to a quick call?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: 88% cache hit rate on AI lead scoring -- here's how

Hi Howard,

Quick follow-up. One thing I built that's directly relevant to Ylopo's multi-channel approach: a cross-channel context preservation system.

When a lead starts on AI text and transitions to voice (or vice versa), my system preserves the full conversation context -- qualification status, budget, timeline, and intent signals. Zero re-qualification needed across channels.

15 minutes to walk through the architecture?

Cayman

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: Multi-channel AI orchestration resource

Hi Howard,

I documented the architecture for cross-channel AI handoffs in real estate (text, voice, chat). Happy to share -- just reply "send it."

### Connection Request

Hi Howard -- Fellow real estate AI builder here. I've been following Ylopo's evolution from rAIya to full AI voice. I built a multi-LLM orchestration system that cut real estate AI costs by 89%. Would love to connect.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting, Howard. I built a system that preserves lead context across AI channels (text, voice, chat) with zero re-qualification and 89% cost reduction. For Ylopo's multi-channel approach, this could reduce per-conversation costs significantly. Open to a 15-minute demo?
