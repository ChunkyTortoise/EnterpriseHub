# Prospect: CINC (Commissions Inc)

## Company Research

CINC (Commissions, Inc.) is the #1 all-in-one real estate lead generation and conversion CRM platform for teams and top agents. Founded in 2011, headquartered in Atlanta, GA. CEO is Alvaro (former COO), co-founded by Duane LeGate (E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year 2016). Acquired by Fidelity National Financial (FNF). CINC AI is available as an add-on that uses conversational AI for immediate lead response and qualification.

## Why They're a Fit

CINC's AI add-on is a conversational lead qualification system -- directly comparable to Jorge Bot. Being acquired by FNF means enterprise requirements for compliance, security, and cost optimization. Their AI add-on pricing means they're monetizing AI directly and need to keep costs low to maintain margins.

## Personalization Hooks

- CINC AI add-on means they're selling AI as a product -- margins matter
- FNF acquisition means enterprise compliance requirements
- #1 market position means high lead volume through their system
- AI as "add-on" suggests it's still separate from core platform -- integration opportunity

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: 88% cache hit rate on AI lead scoring -- here's how

Hi team,

CINC's AI add-on for lead qualification is smart product packaging. Immediate AI response to new leads is the table stakes now -- the question is how to do it profitably at scale.

I built a lead qualification system for real estate that achieves:

- **89% LLM cost reduction** through intelligent caching (critical when AI is a per-seat add-on)
- **Multi-LLM orchestration** with automatic fallback chains
- **Compliance-first architecture** (DRE, Fair Housing, CCPA -- relevant for an FNF subsidiary)

For CINC, the math matters: if the AI add-on costs $X/seat in LLM fees, reducing that by 89% dramatically improves the margin on every seat sold. At your agent volume, that's significant.

Worth a 15-minute conversation about the architecture?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: 88% cache hit rate on AI lead scoring -- here's how

Quick follow-up. For CINC's AI add-on, here's the key insight: real estate lead conversations are highly repetitive. "What's my budget?", "When do you want to move?", "Are you pre-approved?" -- these patterns cache beautifully.

My system's 88% hit rate means 88 out of 100 AI responses come from cache, not the API. At enterprise scale, that's the difference between a profitable add-on and a cost center.

15 minutes to discuss the architecture?

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: AI cost optimization for real estate platforms

I've got a brief on optimizing AI costs for real estate lead qualification at scale. Reply "send it" if useful.

### Connection Request

Hi -- I build production AI systems for real estate lead qualification. CINC's AI add-on is smart packaging -- I achieved 89% cost reduction on a similar system. Would love to connect and share notes.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting. CINC's AI add-on margins depend on per-conversation LLM costs. My 3-tier caching system (88% hit rate) reduces those costs by 89%. For a per-seat product, that's the difference between profitable and break-even. Open to a 15-minute architecture walkthrough?
