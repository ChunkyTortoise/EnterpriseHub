# Prospect: Rechat

**Segment**: PropTech Founder | **Template**: Template 2
**Priority**: Batch 2, Week 2

## Company Research

Rechat is a real estate "super app" for residential agents, founded by Shayan Hamidi (CEO) in 2016 and headquartered in Dallas, TX. The platform handles relationships, marketing, and transaction management. Recently launched AI-powered tools to connect real estate agents using listing data, location filters, and automated tools. $2.2M revenue with a 39-person team in 2024. Shayan has 15+ years in SaaS and internet solutions.

## Why They're a Fit

Rechat is building AI features on a lean team (39 people) with limited AI engineering resources. A fractional AI CTO or architecture audit could provide the production-grade AI expertise they need without a full-time hire. Their agent-matching AI tool uses the same pattern as lead qualification -- scoring, filtering, and intelligent routing.

## Personalization Hooks

- 39-person team means limited internal AI engineering capacity
- Recently launched AI-powered agent matching -- expanding AI surface area
- $2.2M revenue with growth ambitions -- need to scale AI efficiently
- Shayan's SaaS background means he understands infrastructure decisions

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: 88% cache hit rate on AI lead scoring -- here's how

Hi Shayan,

Rechat's AI-powered agent matching tool is a smart extension of the platform. Matching agents using listing data and location filters is an interesting scoring problem.

I built a similar scoring system for real estate -- but for lead qualification. The architecture might be relevant:

- **Multi-LLM orchestration** (Claude + Gemini) with automatic fallback chains
- **3-tier caching** that reduced API costs by 89% (critical for a 39-person team watching margins)
- **Scored handoffs** between specialized AI agents with zero context loss

For Rechat's size and growth stage, production-grade AI infrastructure is often the difference between a feature that works in demos and one that works at scale. I've built 11 production repositories with 8,500+ tests -- this is what I do.

Would a 15-minute demo of the architecture be useful?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: 88% cache hit rate on AI lead scoring -- here's how

Hi Shayan,

Quick follow-up. For a lean team like Rechat's, the fractional AI CTO model is worth considering:

- $8,000/mo for ~50 hours of architecture ownership, feature development, and code reviews
- Compare: a full-time senior AI engineer costs $200-300K/year + 3-6 months to hire

My entry point is a $2,500 Architecture Audit -- scored assessment across six categories with a migration roadmap. Most audits identify $5K-$15K/month in savings.

Worth a 30-minute discovery call?

Cayman

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: AI architecture resource for lean teams

I've got a brief on building production AI with small teams (caching, testing, deployment). Reply "send it" if useful.

### Connection Request

Hi Shayan -- I build production AI systems for real estate platforms. Rechat's agent matching tool caught my eye. As a fractional AI CTO, I help lean teams ship production-grade AI. Would love to connect.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting, Shayan. For a 39-person team building AI features, production infrastructure matters. I've got 11 repos with 8,500+ tests and achieved 89% LLM cost reduction. My $2,500 Architecture Audit could identify quick wins for Rechat's AI stack. Open to a quick chat?
