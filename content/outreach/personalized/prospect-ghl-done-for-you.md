GHL Done For You is a GoHighLevel agency providing end-to-end service, handling everything from onboarding through customization for non-technical founders. They position themselves as the "done for you" solution for business owners who want GHL's power without the learning curve.

## Why They're a Fit

Their target market (non-technical founders) means they need turnkey AI solutions that "just work." These clients won't build their own AI integrations but will pay for intelligent automation. GHL Done For You could offer AI-powered lead qualification as a premium managed service on top of their existing GHL setups.

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your GHL setup is leaving money on the table

Hi there,

GHL Done For You's approach resonates -- non-technical founders need automation that works without them thinking about it.

Here's a thought: what if the AI in your clients' GHL accounts was also "done for you"? I built an orchestration system that sits on top of GHL and handles intelligent lead qualification, bot-to-bot handoffs, and cost optimization without any manual intervention.

The numbers from a live deployment:
- **89% lower AI costs** than standard GHL bot setups
- **Zero context loss** when leads move between conversation types
- **Automatic lead scoring** with Hot/Warm/Cold tag routing

For your non-technical clients, this means their GHL account gets smarter leads, faster responses, and lower costs -- without them touching a single setting.

Worth a 15-minute look?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your GHL setup is leaving money on the table

Quick follow-up. The "done for you" angle on AI is particularly compelling because your clients don't want to manage AI models or worry about API costs. The system I built handles all of that automatically -- caching, cost optimization, and routing are invisible to the end user.

15 minutes to walk through how it could work as a premium tier?
