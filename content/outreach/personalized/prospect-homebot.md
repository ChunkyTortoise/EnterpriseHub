# Prospect: Homebot

## Company Research

Homebot is an AI-driven mortgage lending and real estate software platform based in Denver, CO. Acquired by private equity firm ASG (their first expansion into residential real estate software). The platform uses AI to identify homeowners and buyers likely to make a transaction soon, helping loan officers and real estate agents stay in touch with customers. Won HW Tech100 Mortgage in 2020. Focuses on predictive analytics for homeownership decisions.

## Why They're a Fit

Homebot's predictive AI for identifying likely-to-transact homeowners is a scoring and qualification problem -- the same domain as the Jorge Bot system. ASG acquisition means they need to demonstrate cost efficiency and scalability. Their AI-driven predictions could benefit from multi-LLM orchestration and caching.

## Personalization Hooks

- ASG acquisition means PE-backed efficiency pressure
- Predictive AI for transaction likelihood aligns with lead scoring architecture
- Serving both loan officers and agents means dual-persona AI needs
- Denver-based with national reach -- scaling challenges

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: 88% cache hit rate on AI lead scoring -- here's how

Hi team,

Homebot's predictive approach to identifying likely-to-transact homeowners is clever -- turning passive homeownership data into actionable intelligence for loan officers and agents.

I built a similar predictive system for real estate lead qualification with some architectural innovations that might be relevant:

- **Multi-LLM orchestration** scoring across 10+ dimensions (budget, timeline, motivation, pre-approval)
- **89% LLM cost reduction** via 3-tier caching (critical under PE-backed efficiency targets)
- **Dual-persona routing** -- different AI responses for buyer vs seller intent

For Homebot's model, the caching layer is particularly relevant: homeownership patterns and transaction predictions follow seasonal and regional patterns. A semantic cache can serve predictions for similar profiles without re-running the model.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: 88% cache hit rate on AI lead scoring -- here's how

Quick follow-up. Under PE ownership, AI cost efficiency becomes a board-level metric. My Architecture Audit ($2,500) delivers a scored assessment of your AI pipeline with specific cost reduction projections.

Most audits identify $5K-$15K/month in savings. At Homebot's scale, the ROI is typically 5-10x in the first year.

30 minutes to discuss?

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: Predictive AI cost optimization resource

I documented the caching architecture that reduced predictive AI costs by 89%. Happy to share -- reply "send it."

### Connection Request

Hi -- I build predictive AI systems for real estate (89% cost reduction, multi-LLM orchestration). Homebot's approach to transaction prediction is impressive. Would love to connect.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting. Under PE ownership, AI cost efficiency matters more than ever. My $2,500 Architecture Audit identifies $5K-$15K/month in AI savings with specific benchmarks. Could be relevant for Homebot's predictive platform. Open to a quick chat?
