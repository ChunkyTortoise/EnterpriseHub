# Prospect: Firecrawl

**Segment**: SaaS CTO | **Template**: Template 3
**Priority**: Batch 3, Week 3

## Company Research

Firecrawl is a web scraping and data extraction platform designed for AI applications, particularly RAG pipelines. They help companies crawl websites and extract clean data for LLM consumption. The platform has published extensive thought leadership on enterprise RAG platforms, vector databases, and AI infrastructure. They position themselves as the data ingestion layer for RAG systems -- turning messy web data into clean, structured input for AI.

## Why They're a Fit

Firecrawl sits in the RAG data ingestion layer -- the step before the RAG pipeline processes queries. Their customers need to build complete RAG stacks on top of the data Firecrawl extracts. A partnership or consulting model could work: Firecrawl handles data extraction, and Cayman handles the RAG pipeline, orchestration, and application layer above it.

## Personalization Hooks

- RAG data ingestion is the foundation layer -- they understand the full stack
- Publishing best practices on enterprise RAG platforms shows thought leadership
- Customers who use Firecrawl for data extraction need RAG implementation next
- Their blog covers vector databases, RAG tools, and AI infrastructure comprehensively

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your AI pipeline is costing you 40-80% more than it should

Hi team,

Firecrawl solves the hardest part of RAG: getting clean, structured data from messy web sources. Your customers come to you for data extraction -- but what happens next?

I build the next layer: production RAG pipelines that process Firecrawl's extracted data into intelligent, cost-optimized AI applications:

- **RAG pipeline** with BM25 + semantic search + re-ranking
- **Multi-LLM orchestration** with 89% cost reduction via 3-tier caching
- **8,500+ automated tests** -- production-grade, not prototype-grade
- **CRM integrations** (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce) on top of the RAG layer

Your customers who extract data with Firecrawl often need implementation support for the full RAG stack. I could serve as a recommended implementation partner.

Worth a 30-minute conversation about whether a partnership makes sense?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your AI pipeline is costing you 40-80% more than it should

Quick follow-up. The partnership model I'm proposing:

1. Customer uses Firecrawl for data extraction
2. Customer needs a production RAG pipeline on top of that data
3. Firecrawl recommends me for implementation
4. I build the pipeline using the data Firecrawl extracts

Clean handoff, clear value chain, and both sides win. 15 minutes to discuss?

Cayman

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: RAG pipeline architecture for extracted data

I documented the full RAG pipeline architecture I build on top of extracted data (BM25 + semantic + re-ranking, 88% cache hit rate). Reply "send it" if useful.

### Connection Request

Hi -- I build production RAG pipelines (89% cost reduction, 8,500+ tests) that sit on top of data extraction layers like Firecrawl. There might be a natural partnership. Would love to connect.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting. Your customers extract data with Firecrawl -- and then need production RAG pipelines built on top of it. I build those: BM25 + semantic search, multi-LLM orchestration, CRM integration. Partnership could be mutually beneficial. Open to a quick chat?
