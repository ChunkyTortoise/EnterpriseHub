## Company Research

GHL Hero is a GoHighLevel agency specializing in rapid onboarding and streamlined automation processes for coaches, consultants, and small agencies. They have deep technical knowledge including Zapier, Make.com, and custom API integrations, and handle complex GHL workflows for their clients.

## Why They're a Fit

GHL Hero works with coaches and consultants who rely heavily on AI-powered chat, appointment booking, and lead nurturing. Their custom API integration experience means they can appreciate the technical depth of a production AI orchestration system. They likely encounter scaling issues as their clients' GHL accounts grow in complexity.

## Personalization Hooks

- Specializes in "rapid onboarding" -- AI orchestration could accelerate this further
- Custom API integration skills mean they'd understand the technical architecture
- Coaches and consultants are heavy users of conversational AI in GHL
- Complex workflow handling suggests they hit scaling limits regularly

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your GHL setup is leaving money on the table

Hi there,

I've been looking at GHL Hero's work with complex workflows and custom API integrations. Solid technical depth.

Here's something I think would resonate: I built an AI orchestration layer for GHL that takes those complex multi-step workflows to another level. Instead of linear bot flows, the system uses confidence-scored handoffs between specialized bots -- each one handling a different intent (qualification, buying, selling).

The results on a real estate operation:

- **89% LLM cost reduction** through 3-tier Redis caching
- **Zero context loss** during bot transitions (conversation history, budget, timeline all preserved)
- **Automatic Hot/Warm/Cold tagging** that triggers the right workflow

For your coaching and consulting clients, imagine: a lead comes in, gets qualified by one bot, handed off to a specialized "enrollment" bot with full context, and tagged for the right nurture sequence -- all in under 200ms.

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your GHL setup is leaving money on the table

Quick follow-up. For the coaching/consulting clients you serve, here's the math:

A typical AI-powered GHL workflow costs $0.03-0.05 per conversation turn. With 1,000 conversations/month across a client's subaccount, that's $30-50/month. With my 88% cache hit rate, 880 of those conversations hit cache instead of the API. Cost drops to under $6/month.

Scale that across all your clients and the savings are significant. Happy to run the numbers on a real account in 15 minutes.

I've got a quick guide on the 3 highest-ROI AI optimizations for coaching/consulting GHL setups. Reply "send it" if useful.

### Connection Request

Hi -- I build AI orchestration systems for GHL agencies. GHL Hero's work with complex workflows and custom APIs caught my eye. Would love to connect and share notes on advanced GHL automation.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting. I built a multi-bot handoff system on GHL that cuts AI costs by 89% and preserves full context during transitions. For coaching/consulting clients, it means leads get qualified and enrolled without re-asking questions. Open to a 15-minute walkthrough?
