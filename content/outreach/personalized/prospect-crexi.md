# Prospect: Crexi

**Segment**: PropTech Founder | **Template**: Template 2
**Priority**: Batch 3, Week 3

## Company Research

Crexi is a commercial real estate technology platform founded by Michael DeGiorgio (CEO) in 2015, headquartered in Los Angeles, CA. Raised $110M in total funding from investors including Lerer Hippeau, Jackson Square Ventures, and Mitsubishi Estate. Over $1 trillion in property value listed on the platform. They use AI-powered insights for CRE data and recently saw co-founder Luke Morris launch a separate AI company (Capitalize.io) for CRE debt.

## Why They're a Fit

Crexi handles massive CRE data volumes and uses AI for insights and listing descriptions. Their data scale ($1T+ in property value) means they need efficient AI processing. The co-founder spinning off an AI company signals the team's deep interest in AI applications. Crexi could benefit from RAG pipelines for document search across listings and market data.

## Personalization Hooks

- $1T+ in property value on platform means massive data scale
- Co-founder Luke Morris launched AI company Capitalize.io -- AI interest is deep
- AI-powered insights for CRE data suggests existing ML/AI pipeline
- 500,000+ commercial listings means huge document corpus for RAG

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Your lead qualification is slower than your competitors'

Hi Michael,

Congrats on Crexi surpassing $1T in listed property value. That's a remarkable data moat.

With 500,000+ commercial listings, Crexi's AI insights are processing an enormous document corpus. I built a system that handles this exact challenge -- high-volume real estate data processed through multi-LLM orchestration with intelligent caching.

Key results:
- **89% reduction in LLM costs** via 3-tier caching (88% hit rate)
- **RAG pipeline** with BM25 + semantic search + re-ranking
- **Sub-200ms orchestration** for real-time insights

For Crexi's data scale, even a 30-40% cost reduction on AI processing would be meaningful. My $2,500 Architecture Audit would identify specific optimization opportunities across your AI pipeline.

Worth a 30-minute discovery call?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: Your lead qualification is slower than your competitors'

Hi Michael,

Follow-up with a CRE-specific example: listing descriptions, market comps, and property data follow predictable patterns. A semantic caching layer can detect when a query about "retail space in downtown LA" is similar enough to a cached response about "commercial retail, DTLA" and serve the cached result.

At 500K+ listings, this overlap drives significant cost savings.

15 minutes to discuss?

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: AI architecture for CRE data at scale

I've got a brief on RAG pipeline architecture for large real estate document corpora. Reply "send it" if useful.

### Connection Request

Hi Michael -- I build RAG pipelines and AI orchestration systems for real estate. Crexi's $1T+ listing data is a remarkable moat. Would love to connect and discuss AI optimization for CRE data at scale.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting, Michael. I built a RAG pipeline with 89% cost reduction for real estate data processing. For Crexi's 500K+ listings, semantic caching and multi-LLM orchestration could significantly reduce AI costs. My $2,500 audit identifies specific savings. Open to a quick chat?
