## Company Research

Fusemate is a white-label GoHighLevel support agency founded by Anthony Puttee. They provide outsourced GHL development, automation, website/funnel building, and graphic design for digital agencies. They serve as a "plug-in marketing team" for agencies that need GHL expertise without hiring full-time staff.

## Why They're a Fit

Fusemate handles GHL automation for multiple agencies, meaning they manage dozens of subaccounts with varying automation complexity. They likely encounter bot handoff issues, LLM cost scaling problems, and workflow optimization challenges across their client base. An AI orchestration layer could be a premium service offering for their agency clients.

## Personalization Hooks

- Anthony founded Fusemate out of frustration with finding reliable automation support
- They are a Digital Marketer certified partner
- Featured in a Cloudways Agency Spotlight about building scalable tech systems
- They offer unlimited project queuing -- AI automation could be a scalable add-on

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: How we cut a GHL agency's AI costs by 89%

Hi Anthony,

I saw Fusemate's Cloudways feature on building scalable tech systems for agencies. Smart approach to white-label GHL support.

Quick question: when your agency clients are running AI-powered workflows in GHL, are they losing lead context during bot handoffs? Most GHL setups I audit are dropping 30-50% of qualified leads at the transition point.

I built an AI orchestration layer on GHL for a real estate operation that solved this:

- **89% reduction in LLM costs** ($3,600/mo to $400/mo)
- **Zero context loss** on handoffs between specialized bots
- **Sub-200ms response times** with multi-bot coordination

This could be a powerful add-on service for Fusemate's agency clients. I'd love to do a free 15-minute mini-audit of one of your GHL setups to show you what's possible.

Worth a quick look?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: How we cut a GHL agency's AI costs by 89%

Hi Anthony,

Following up on my earlier note. I know you're busy managing multiple agency accounts.

One thing I forgot to mention: the 3-tier caching system I built achieves an 88% cache hit rate. For agencies running AI across multiple subaccounts, this means most queries never hit the LLM API at all. At scale, that's thousands of dollars per month in savings that you could pass through to clients or keep as margin.

Happy to share the architecture in a 15-minute call if you're curious.

Cayman

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: Quick resource for GHL AI optimization

Hi Anthony,

Last note from me. I put together a quick checklist of the 5 most common GHL automation bottlenecks I see in agency setups (context loss, LLM overspend, slow handoffs, missing rate limits, no cache layer).

If you'd find it useful, just reply "send it" and I'll share it. No call required.

Either way, love what Fusemate is building for the agency space.

### Connection Request (300 chars)

Hi Anthony -- I build AI orchestration systems for GHL agencies. Saw Fusemate's work on scalable tech for agencies and thought we might have some overlap. Would love to connect and share notes on GHL automation.

### Follow-Up Message

Hi Anthony, thanks for connecting. I recently built a system that reduced a GHL agency's LLM costs by 89% using a 3-tier caching layer. Most GHL shops I talk to are overpaying on AI API calls by 40-80%. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute audit of your setup? Free, no pitch -- just specifics.
