## Company Research

Structurely is an AI-powered sales platform based in Iowa, featuring "Aisa Holmes" (Artificial Intelligence Inside Sales Agent). The platform automates lead qualification through calling, texting, and appointment setting. They report 50% reduction in sales overhead costs, 17% more qualified leads, and 31% higher answer rates. Aisa Holmes engages prospects via SMS, web chat, and Facebook Messenger with natural language processing, including human touches like deliberate typos and empathy.

## Why They're a Fit

Structurely's Aisa Holmes is a conversational AI agent doing lead qualification -- the exact domain of the Jorge Bot case study. They handle multi-channel communication (calling, texting, chat) which creates complex orchestration needs. Their focus on human-like conversation aligns with the persona-based bot architecture used in EnterpriseHub.

## Personalization Hooks

- Aisa Holmes' deliberate typos and empathy features show sophistication in conversational AI
- 50% sales overhead reduction is impressive but 89% LLM cost reduction is better
- Multi-channel (calling, texting, chat) creates handoff complexity
- 12+ month nurture campaigns mean long conversation context windows
- Bilingual (Spanish/English) support adds AI complexity

### Day 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: 88% cache hit rate on AI lead scoring -- here's how

Hi there,

Aisa Holmes' approach to lead qualification is impressive -- the deliberate typos and empathy features show real depth in conversational AI design. Most chatbots feel robotic, but Structurely clearly gets the nuance.

I built something in the same space: a multi-bot lead qualification system for real estate that takes a different architectural approach. Instead of one bot handling everything, I use three specialized bots (Lead, Buyer, Seller) with intelligent handoffs between them.

Key difference in results:
- **89% LLM cost reduction** vs Structurely's 50% overhead reduction
- **Zero context loss** during handoffs (conversation history, budget, timeline preserved)
- **0.7 confidence threshold** with learned adjustments from historical outcomes

The secret sauce is a 3-tier caching layer (88% hit rate) and multi-LLM orchestration (Claude + Gemini with fallback chains).

I'd love to exchange notes on conversational AI architecture. Open to a 15-minute call?

### Day 4: Follow-Up

**Subject**: Re: 88% cache hit rate on AI lead scoring -- here's how

Quick follow-up. One specific thing that might interest Structurely's team: my handoff system uses pattern learning from historical outcomes to dynamically adjust confidence thresholds.

After 10+ data points on a particular handoff pattern (e.g., lead showing buyer intent), the system automatically tunes the threshold. This means the qualification accuracy improves over time without manual intervention.

15 minutes to compare approaches?

### Day 8: Final Touch

**Subject**: Conversational AI architecture resource

I documented the multi-bot handoff architecture that achieves zero context loss during lead transitions. Happy to share -- just reply "send it."

### Connection Request

Hi -- I build multi-bot lead qualification systems for real estate. Aisa Holmes' approach to human-like AI conversation is impressive. I achieved 89% LLM cost reduction with a different architectural pattern. Would love to connect and compare notes.

### Follow-Up Message

Thanks for connecting. I built a system using specialized bots with intelligent handoffs (0.7 confidence threshold, learned adjustments) instead of a single-bot approach. 89% cost reduction, zero context loss. Different philosophy than Aisa Holmes but same goal. Open to a 15-minute architecture swap?
