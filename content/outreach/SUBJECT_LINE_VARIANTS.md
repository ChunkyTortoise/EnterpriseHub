**Proven Formulas:**
1. **Problem + Solution**: "Scaling {{problem}} at {{company}}"
2. **Question Format**: "Are you tracking {{metric}} at {{company}}?"
3. **Curiosity Gap**: "{{specific_topic}} from someone who built it"
4. **Social Proof**: "How {{similar_company}} achieved {{result}}"
5. **Direct Relevance**: "{{company}} + {{your_solution}}"
6. **News Trigger**: "Re: {{recent_announcement}}"

## Spam Filter Avoidance

### Subject Line Red Flags to Avoid

| Spam Trigger | Why It's Bad | Alternative |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| ALL CAPS | Looks like shouting | Sentence case |
| Multiple !!! | Overexcitement | Single period |
| "FREE" | Spam keyword | "No-cost trial" |
| "URGENT" | Creates false urgency | "Time-sensitive" |
| "Re:" (when not a reply) | Deceptive | Only use in follow-ups |
| "$$$" | Spam symbol | "ROI" or "Revenue" |
| "Act now" | Pushy CTA | "When's a good time?" |

---

## Mobile Optimization

### Subject Line Preview Length by Device

| Device | Characters Visible | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| **iPhone** | ~40 characters | Front-load key words |
| **Android** | ~50 characters | Full subject visible |
| **Desktop** | ~60 characters | Can use full length |

**Strategy:** Place company name and key benefit in first 40 characters.

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "I wanted to reach out to discuss how our AI platform could help {{company}} with..."
- ✅ Good: "{{company}} - AI platform that reduced costs by 60%"
