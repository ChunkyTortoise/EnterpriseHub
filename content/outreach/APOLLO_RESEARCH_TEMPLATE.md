- [ ] Industry classification (verify SIC/NAICS codes)

### 3. Pain Point Identification
- [ ] Recent job postings (hiring for AI/ML roles? Indicates scaling AI)
- [ ] Tech stack gaps (e.g., using GPT-4 but no caching layer)
- [ ] Competitor analysis (who are they competing against?)
- [ ] Growth indicators (new offices, expanding teams, recent press)
- [ ] Compliance requirements (industry-specific: HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR)

### 4. Personalization Hooks

- [ ] GitHub activity (if technical founder/CTO)
- [ ] Conference talks or podcast appearances
- [ ] Company blog posts mentioning AI/ML initiatives

### 5. Timing Signals

- [ ] Leadership changes (new CTO/VP Eng = opportunity for new vendors)
- [ ] Competitor moves (if competitor just launched AI, they'll feel pressure)

## Apollo.io Research Workflow

### Step 1: People Search
1. Go to Apollo.io → People
2. Search by:
   - Company name (exact match)
   - Job titles: "CTO", "VP Engineering", "Head of AI", "Chief Product Officer"
   - Location: Filter by HQ location or "Remote"
3. Export contact details:
   - Full name
   - Title
   - Email (Apollo.io verified)
   - LinkedIn URL
   - Phone (if available)

### Step 2: Company Search
1. Go to Apollo.io → Companies
2. Search by company name
3. Extract:
   - Employee count
   - Revenue estimate (Apollo.io's range)
   - Funding stage (Seed, Series A/B/C, etc.)
   - Technologies used (Technographics tab)
   - Recent news/announcements

### Step 3: Technographics Analysis
1. Check company's tech stack in Apollo.io Technographics
2. Look for:
   - **AI/ML tools**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, AWS Bedrock
   - **CRMs**: Salesforce, HubSpot, GoHighLevel
   - **Cloud**: AWS, GCP, Azure
   - **Data**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
3. Identify gaps:
   - Using LLMs but no caching layer = cost optimization opportunity
   - Multiple CRMs = integration/consolidation opportunity
   - No AI tools = greenfield opportunity

### Step 4: Intent Data (Apollo.io Job Postings)
1. Go to Apollo.io → Jobs
2. Search for company's open positions
3. Look for signals:
   - Hiring "AI Engineer" or "ML Engineer" → scaling AI team
   - "LLM Engineer" or "Prompt Engineer" → building in-house AI
   - "Integration Engineer" → need help connecting systems
   - "Data Engineer" → building data infrastructure

### Step 5: Enrichment from Alternative Sources
If Apollo.io data is incomplete, cross-reference:
- **LinkedIn**: Decision maker's recent activity, company page updates
- **Crunchbase**: Funding history, investors, acquisition status
- **GitHub**: Company repos (if public), tech stack clues
- **Job boards** (Lever, Greenhouse): Open positions signal priorities
- **Company blog**: AI/ML announcements, engineering posts
