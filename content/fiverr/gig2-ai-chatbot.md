# Fiverr Gig: AI Chatbot with Multi-Agent Handoff

**Category:** AI Services > AI Chatbots  
**Gig Title:** Build a Multi-Agent AI Chatbot with Smart Handoff & CRM Integration  
**Price Range:** $200 - $500 USD

---

## Gig Description

Deploy an intelligent multi-agent chatbot that seamlessly transfers conversations between specialized AI bots based on customer needs. Built on the proven EnterpriseHub architecture with 4,937 tests and 3 production-ready bot personas.

### What I Deliver:

- **Specialized Agents:** Lead qualification, buyer assistance, and seller consultation bots
- **Smart Handoffs:** Automatic context-aware transfers between agents
- **CRM Integration:** Sync conversations with GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Smooth escalation to human agents when needed
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Track conversations, satisfaction, and conversion rates

### How It Works

The chatbot uses a swarm architecture where specialized agents handle different aspects of real estate inquiries. When a conversation shifts context (e.g., from "I'm looking" to "I want to sell"), the bot automatically transfers to the appropriate specialist while preserving conversation history.

## FAQ

### Q: What platforms can this chatbot integrate with?

**A:** I support web widgets (copy/paste embed), WordPress, React, Vue, and API integration. CRM integrations include GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce, and custom webhooks. Premium includes Zapier integration.

---

### Q: How does the handoff system work?

**A:** The system analyzes conversation intent in real-time. When confidence exceeds 0.7 and trigger phrases are detected, the conversation smoothly transfers to the specialist agent. Context (conversation history, extracted data) is preserved. Handoffs are logged and monitored.

---

### Q: Can I customize the bot personalities?

**A:** Absolutely. Each agent has configurable:
- Tone (professional, friendly, formal)
- Response style (concise, detailed)
- Knowledge domains
- Escalation triggers
- Custom welcome messages

---

### Q: What happens if the bot can't answer a question?

**A:** The bot has fallback logic for unrecognized intents. After 2 failed attempts, it offers to:
1. Re-phrase the question
2. Connect to a human agent (Premium)
3. Take a message for follow-up

---

### Q: Is conversation data secure?

**A:** Yes. All conversations are encrypted at rest. I use your API keys (recommended) so data stays with your provider. For Premium, on-premise deployment is available. HIPAA compliance support for healthcare use cases.

---

### Q: Can this be used for industries other than real estate?

**A:** Yes! The architecture is domain-agnostic. I've deployed variants for:
- Legal services (intake → consultation → case management)
- Healthcare (symptom → appointment → records)
- E-commerce (product → support → sales)
- Financial services (inquiry → consultation → onboarding)

---

### Q: How do I track ROI?

**A:** Premium includes an analytics dashboard with:
- Conversations by stage
- Lead scoring distribution
- Conversion funnels
- Response time trends
