## Gig Description (SEO Enhanced)

Deploy an intelligent multi-agent chatbot that seamlessly transfers conversations between specialized AI bots based on customer needs. Perfect for businesses that need automated lead qualification, customer support, and CRM integration. Built on the proven EnterpriseHub architecture with 4,937 tests and 3 production-ready bot personas.

### What I Deliver:

- **Specialized Agents:** Lead qualification, buyer assistance, and seller consultation bots
- **Smart Handoffs:** Automatic context-aware transfers between agents
- **CRM Integration:** Sync conversations with GoHighLevel, HubSpot, or Salesforce
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Smooth escalation to human agents when needed
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Track conversations, satisfaction, and conversion rates

### How It Works

The chatbot uses a swarm architecture where specialized agents handle different aspects of real estate inquiries. When a conversation shifts context (e.g., from "I'm looking" to "I want to sell"), the bot automatically transfers to the appropriate specialist while preserving conversation history.

## FAQ

### Q: What platforms can this chatbot integrate with?

**A:** I support web widgets (copy/paste embed), WordPress, React, Vue, and API integration. CRM integrations include GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce, and custom webhooks. Premium includes Zapier integration.

---

### Q: How does the handoff system work?

**A:** The system analyzes conversation intent in real-time. When confidence exceeds 0.7 and trigger phrases are detected, the conversation smoothly transfers to the specialist agent. Context (conversation history, extracted data) is preserved. Handoffs are logged and monitored.

---

### Q: Can I customize the bot personalities?

**A:** Absolutely. Each agent has configurable:
- Tone (professional, friendly, formal)
- Response style (concise, detailed)
- Knowledge domains
- Escalation triggers
- Custom welcome messages

---

### Q: What happens if the bot can't answer a question?

**A:** The bot has fallback logic for unrecognized intents. After 2 failed attempts, it offers to:
1. Re-phrase the question
2. Connect to a human agent (Premium)
3. Take a message for follow-up

---

### Q: Is conversation data secure?

**A:** Yes. All conversations are encrypted at rest. I use your API keys (recommended) so data stays with your provider. For Premium, on-premise deployment is available. HIPAA compliance support for healthcare use cases.

---

### Q: Can this be used for industries other than real estate?

**A:** Yes! The architecture is domain-agnostic. I've deployed variants for:
- Legal services (intake → consultation → case management)
- Healthcare (symptom → appointment → records)
- E-commerce (product → support → sales)
- Financial services (inquiry → consultation → onboarding)
