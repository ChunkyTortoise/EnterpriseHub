## Gig Title

I will build your AI-powered GTM workflow with GoHighLevel MCP integration

---

## Gig Description

### What's keeping you from closing more deals?

You're getting on calls. You're writing proposals by hand. You're manually updating your CRM. You're losing hours every week to work that an AI agent could do in minutes.

I build AI-powered GTM systems that connect directly to your GoHighLevel CRM — not through Zapier, not through webhooks, but through a direct MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. This means AI agents that can **read your contacts, update fields, add tags, trigger workflows, and move deals through your pipeline in real time**.

**Here's what I'll build for you:**

- **Proposal-from-Transcript Agent**: Drop in a sales call recording or transcript, get a fully scoped proposal back with pricing, deliverables, and timeline — automatically synced to your GHL contact record
- **ICP Definition Engine**: Analyze your last 20-50 closed contacts in GHL and generate a data-backed Ideal Customer Profile — who to target, what messaging works, what disqualifies fast
- **Automated Workflows**: AI-triggered CRM sequences that score, tag, and route leads without manual work

I've built this exact system for my own agency and for clients — it's not theoretical. My background: AI/ML engineer with 89% AI cost reduction results and $3M revenue impact on deployed systems. 205 passing tests on production code.

**Why this is different from a Zapier integration or a VA:**
- Agents reason about context, not just pass data between APIs
- GHL MCP means AI can act on CRM data without custom code per workflow
- Works with your existing GHL setup — no migration, no new tools

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need a specific GoHighLevel plan?**
A: Any GHL plan works — Agency Starter, Pro, or white-label. You just need API access (available on all plans).

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: No. I deliver everything ready to use. You'll get a runbook that explains how to run each agent in plain language. Optional: I can train your team on prompt modifications.

**Q: What AI model do you use?**
A: Claude (Anthropic) by default — claude-sonnet-4-6 for quality work, Claude Haiku for high-volume automations to manage costs. You provide your own Anthropic API key (usually $5-30/month for typical usage). I won't lock you into my key or charge API markup.

**Q: How much does it cost to run after delivery?**
A: AI API costs (Anthropic) are the main ongoing expense — typically $5-30/month depending on volume. GHL subscription cost is separate and already yours. No monthly fee to me after delivery.

**Q: What if my GHL is a mess — custom fields everywhere, no pipeline structure?**
A: That's normal. My GHL audit (included in every tier) maps what you have and recommends a minimal field structure for the agents to work with. We don't need to rebuild your entire CRM.

**Q: Can you integrate with other CRMs?**
A: This gig is specifically for GoHighLevel via MCP. For HubSpot, Salesforce, or other CRMs, message me for a custom quote — the agent architecture is the same, just different tools.

**Q: What's the difference between this and hiring a GHL VA?**
A: A VA runs workflows you design manually. This system uses AI agents that reason: they read context, decide what action to take, and execute — without you defining every rule. Think of it as the difference between a checklist and a judgment call.

**Q: Do you offer hourly consulting?**
A: Yes, at $75/hr for scoping, troubleshooting, or modifications outside these packages. Book via the gig extras.
