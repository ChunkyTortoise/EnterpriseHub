I specialize in RAG document Q&A, multi-agent chatbots with handoff logic, and data dashboards from raw CSV/Excel. Every delivery includes tests, documentation, and deployment-ready code.

## Seller Description (for gig pages)

I'm an AI engineer who turns complex LLM concepts into reliable, tested systems that businesses deploy and scale. My work spans RAG document search, multi-agent chatbot orchestration, and automated data dashboards — all built with production-grade quality standards.

What sets me apart: every system I deliver comes with 80%+ test coverage, comprehensive documentation, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment automation. You don't get a script that "works on my machine" — you get a complete solution with tests, error handling, and monitoring baked in. My portfolio of 11 open-source repositories with 7,016 automated tests backs that up.

Whether you need a document Q&A system that processes 1,000+ pages in under 2 seconds, a chatbot that qualifies leads and hands off to humans at the right moment, or a dashboard that turns your CSV exports into interactive forecasts and clustering analysis — I build it to last. Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Claude/GPT integration, Docker deployment. Production-ready from day one.
