## Gig Description (SEO Enhanced)

Turn your existing blog post, case study, or technical documentation into 6 platform-specific content pieces -- each optimized for its platform's audience, format, and algorithm.

Stop cross-posting the same text everywhere. Each platform rewards different content styles. A LinkedIn post that performs well looks nothing like a Reddit post or a Twitter thread. I'll adapt your core message for maximum engagement on each platform.

### What I Deliver:

- **LinkedIn post** (300-500 words) -- Hook + data + engagement question format
- **Twitter/X thread** (7 tweets) -- Hook/data/CTA thread structure
- **Dev.to article** (1,500-2,500 words) -- Full technical article with code, SEO tags, and CTAs
- **Newsletter edition** (800-1,200 words) -- Personal voice, subject lines, P.S. upsell
- **Reddit post** -- Subreddit-appropriate tone, tl;dr, community-native format
- **YouTube video script** (5-8 min) -- Timestamps, talking points, description + tags

### Why Hire Me:

- AI/ML engineer with production portfolio (11 repos, 8,500+ tests)
- I understand developer audiences because I am one
- Every piece is written to sound native to the platform, not like a copy-paste
- Fast turnaround: 3-5 day delivery for a full batch

## FAQ

**Q: What kind of source content do you need?**
A: Blog posts, case studies, technical documentation, conference talks, README files, ADRs -- any substantial technical content (500+ words). The richer the source, the better the outputs.

**Q: Do you write for non-technical audiences?**
A: My specialty is developer/technical content, but the repurposing system works for any B2B or knowledge-worker audience. If your topic is technical (SaaS, AI/ML, DevOps, data), I'm your person.

**Q: Can I see examples?**
A: Yes. I'll share a portfolio of repurposed content from my own technical case studies (LLM cost optimization, multi-agent orchestration, RAG pipelines).

**Q: Do you publish the content for me?**
A: I deliver copy-paste ready files with formatting guidance. You publish on your own accounts. I can advise on posting strategy during our revision rounds.

**Q: What if my source material is short?**
A: If your source is under 500 words, I'll research the topic and expand the content. This may add 1-2 days to delivery.
