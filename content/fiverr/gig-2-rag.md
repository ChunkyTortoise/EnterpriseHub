## Description (Copy-Paste Ready)

**What if your team could ask any question and get an instant, cited answer from your own documents?**

**The Problem**

Your company has hundreds (or thousands) of PDFs, policies, manuals, and reports scattered across drives and folders. When someone needs an answer, they waste hours searching, scanning, and re-reading. Keyword search returns 50 results but none of them actually answer the question. Critical knowledge lives in documents that nobody has time to read.

**The Solution**

I build custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems that turn your documents into an intelligent Q&A engine. Upload your files, ask a question in plain English, and get a precise answer with the exact source passage highlighted -- in under 200 milliseconds.

- **94% retrieval precision** -- the system finds the right passage, not just the right document
- **96% citation accuracy** -- every answer links to its source with page numbers
- **Hybrid search** (keyword + semantic) -- catches what keyword-only search misses
- **Multi-document queries** -- ask across hundreds of documents simultaneously
- **No model training required** -- retrieval-based, so your data stays private

**Why Buyers Trust Me**

- **322 automated tests** validating retrieval accuracy, answer relevance, and citation precision
- **RAGAS evaluation score: 0.89** (industry-standard RAG quality metric)
- **Live demo** at ct-document-engine.streamlit.app -- upload your own documents and test it
- **11 open-source repos** with 8,500+ total tests and 80%+ coverage

**Real Results**

- Legal firm: 85% reduction in document research time
- SaaS company: 12,000+ questions answered per month
- Non-profit: 500+ policy documents made instantly searchable

**What You Get**

- Production-ready document Q&A system
- Clean web interface for uploading docs and asking questions
- Source citations with highlighted passages
- Docker deployment with scaling capabilities
- Full source code and documentation
- Post-delivery support (see tiers below)

**Have documents your team needs answers from?** Message me with a sample PDF and I will return a working demo within 48 hours -- free, no obligation.

## FAQ (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Q: What document formats do you support?**
PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, and HTML. For PDFs, I extract both text and embedded images. Tables and figures are preserved with additional configuration included in Standard and Premium.

**Q: How accurate are the answers?**
94% retrieval precision and 0.89 RAGAS score (industry-standard metric). Citation accuracy is 96%. Quality depends on document clarity -- well-structured content performs best.

**Q: Can I integrate this into my existing app or website?**
Yes. Standard includes a web interface you can embed. Premium includes a full REST API with documentation, so any system that makes HTTP requests (React, Vue, WordPress, mobile apps) can integrate directly.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. You can use your own API keys so data stays with your provider. Premium includes on-premise deployment so documents never leave your infrastructure. NDA available.

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**
ChatGPT does not know your documents. This system is grounded in YOUR content and cites exact sources. No hallucination risk from general knowledge -- every answer is traceable to a specific passage in your files.
