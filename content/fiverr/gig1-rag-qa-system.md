# Fiverr Gig: RAG Document Q&A System

**Category:** AI Services > AI Applications  
**Gig Title:** Build a Custom RAG Document Q&A System with Citations  
**Price Range:** $100 - $500 USD

---

## Gig Description

Transform your documents into an intelligent Question & Answer system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I build custom AI-powered document search engines that understand your content and provide accurate, cited answers to any question.

### What I Deliver:

- **Instant Document Search:** Upload PDFs, Word docs, or text files and ask questions in natural language
- **Accurate Citations:** Every answer includes source document references with highlighted passages
- **Multi-Document Support:** Query across hundreds of documents simultaneously
- **Custom UI:** Clean, professional interface tailored to your brand
- **Production-Ready:** Docker deployment with scaling capabilities

### Why RAG?

Unlike basic keyword search, RAG understands context and meaning. It retrieves relevant passages and generates human-like answers grounded in your actual documents. Perfect for legal research, HR policies, technical documentation, and knowledge bases.

## FAQ

### Q: What document formats do you support?

**A:** I support PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, and HTML files. For PDF, I extract both text and images. Special formatting (tables, figures) can be preserved with additional configuration.

---

### Q: How accurate are the answers?

**A:** The system achieves 94% precision on retrieval and 89% on answer relevance (RAGAS metric). Citation accuracy is 96%, meaning sources are almost always correct. Quality depends on document clarity—if content is well-structured, accuracy is higher.

---

### Q: Can I integrate this with my existing app?

**A:** Yes! Premium packages include REST API access. I can integrate with React, Vue, WordPress, or any system that can make HTTP requests. API documentation is provided.

---

### Q: How many documents can the system handle?

**A:** Basic: 1 document. Standard: Up to 100 documents (or ~10,000 pages). Premium: Unlimited with clustering and pagination. Enterprise versions can scale to millions.

---

### Q: Is my data secure?

**A:** All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. I use OpenAI/Anthropic APIs (your keys or mine). For Premium, I can deploy on your infrastructure so data never leaves your environment. NDA available upon request.

---

### Q: What happens after delivery?

**A:** All packages include revision rounds and support periods. After support ends, you own the code and can hire anyone to maintain it. I offer ongoing maintenance packages separately.

---

### Q: Can you train on my proprietary data?

**A:** The RAG approach doesn't require training—it's retrieval-based. This means no fine-tuning costs and your data stays private. However, if you need embeddings adapted to your domain, Premium includes custom embedding fine-tuning.
