## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Low Impressions
- **Cause:** Poor SEO tags or title
- **Fix:** Use exact buyer search terms (not technical jargon)
- **Example:** Change "RAG Q&A" → "AI Document Search" (more common)

### High Impressions, Low Clicks
- **Cause:** Weak primary image or title
- **Fix:** Test new images with clearer value prop
- **Example:** Add text overlay: "Get Answers from 1000+ PDFs Instantly"

### High Clicks, No Orders
- **Cause:** Pricing too high or unclear deliverables
- **Fix:** Add Basic tier at lower price ($75 instead of $100)
- **Fix:** Make deliverables more specific ("10 charts" vs "dashboard")

### Orders But Low Reviews
- **Cause:** Over-promising or poor communication
- **Fix:** Under-promise, over-deliver
- **Fix:** Set clear milestones and update buyers daily
