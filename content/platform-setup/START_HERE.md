## 💡 Why This Matters

From the portfolio audit (Feb 2026):

**Current situation**: All products underpriced 50-70% below market
- AgentForge: $39 (should be $149-$249)
- DocQA: $49 (should be $199-$349)

**GitHub Sponsors benefits**:
- ✅ Recurring revenue (MRR vs one-time)
- ✅ Lower friction (developers on GitHub)
- ✅ Community building (engaged advocates)
- ✅ Validation (proof of value)
- ✅ Funnel to consulting (sponsors → clients)

**Revenue strategy**:
- Gumroad: $3K-6K/month (one-time sales)
- Fiverr/Upwork: $5K-15K/month (projects)
- **GitHub Sponsors: $500-2K/month (recurring)** ← YOU ARE HERE
- EnterpriseHub: $10K-30K/month (B2B SaaS)
