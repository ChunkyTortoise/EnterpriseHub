# Task 5: Polar.sh Setup - STATUS

**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Agent**: Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Status**: ⚠️ MANUAL SETUP REQUIRED

---

## Why Manual Setup Is Needed

**Issue**: Browser automation extension not connected

The Claude-in-Chrome browser extension is required for automated setup but is currently not connected. This task requires browser interaction to:
1. Sign in with GitHub OAuth
2. Configure subscription tiers
3. Create digital products
4. Set up newsletter
5. Connect Stripe payouts

**Without browser automation**, the setup must be completed manually.
