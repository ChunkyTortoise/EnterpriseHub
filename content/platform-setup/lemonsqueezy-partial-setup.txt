🔐 IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES
========================================

- Store password is saved locally (not in this file for security)
- You will need to provide your SSN/EIN for tax reporting
- Lemon Squeezy is a US-based Merchant of Record
- They handle all tax compliance (VAT, sales tax, etc.)
- Bank account will be used for payouts (ACH or wire)

========================================
💡 WHY IDENTITY VERIFICATION IS REQUIRED
========================================

Lemon Squeezy acts as your Merchant of Record, which means:
- They legally sell products on your behalf
- They collect and remit taxes (VAT, sales tax)
- They handle fraud prevention
- They need to verify your identity for tax reporting (1099-K forms)
- This is required by US law for payment processors

Typical Verification Timeline:
- Instant approval: If all info matches and no red flags
- 1-3 business days: Standard verification
- 5-7 days: If manual review is needed

========================================
📊 EXPECTED REVENUE (FROM TASK DOCUMENT)
