### Copy-Paste Ready Overview

```
I build AI systems that ship to production — not prototypes that demo well and break under load.

Over the past year, I've built 11 open-source Python repositories with 8,500+ automated tests, all maintaining green CI pipelines. Five have live Streamlit demos you can try right now. This isn't theoretical — it's proven, deployed, and tested at scale.

WHAT I BUILD

LLM Orchestration & Multi-Agent Systems
I design multi-agent architectures where specialized bots handle distinct workflows — lead qualification, buyer engagement, seller conversations — with intelligent handoff logic, circular prevention, and pattern learning from outcomes. My flagship EnterpriseHub platform runs 5,100+ tests and achieves <200ms orchestration overhead (P99: 0.095ms) with 3-tier Redis caching. I've reduced LLM API costs by 89% through intelligent caching strategies verified in production.

RAG Pipelines & Document Intelligence
I build retrieval-augmented generation systems using hybrid BM25 + TF-IDF retrieval without heavy frameworks like LangChain. My DocQA Engine processes 1,000+ page documents in under 2 seconds with citation scoring and 94% accuracy. Every RAG system includes comprehensive testing (500+ tests), performance benchmarks (P50/P95/P99 latency), and deployment automation. No vendor lock-in, no framework bloat — just clean Python with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

Data Dashboards & Analytics
I create interactive analytics platforms with Streamlit — upload a CSV, get time-series forecasting, clustering, anomaly detection, and model quality monitoring. No data engineering team required. My Insight Engine handles everything from data validation to SHAP explainability with 640+ automated tests ensuring reliability.

API Development & CRM Integration
I build FastAPI async backends with Pydantic validation, rate limiting (10 req/sec with Redis), JWT authentication, and integrations with GoHighLevel, HubSpot, and Salesforce using a unified CRM adapter protocol. Every API includes OpenAPI documentation, comprehensive error handling, and Docker deployment.

KEY METRICS

- 8,500+ automated tests across 11 production repositories
- 89% reduction in LLM API costs through 3-tier caching (88% hit rate verified)
- <200ms P95 latency for multi-agent orchestration under 10 req/sec load

WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU HIRE ME

Every engagement includes production-ready deliverables:

- Comprehensive test suite (80%+ coverage) — not just "works on my machine"
- CI/CD pipeline — automated testing on every commit via GitHub Actions
- Docker deployment — consistent environments from dev to prod
- Performance benchmarks — P50/P95/P99 latency verified under load
- Documentation — architecture diagrams, API specs, deployment guides
- Security hardening — input validation, rate limiting, PII encryption
- Knowledge transfer — your team can maintain it after handoff

I don't just write features — I ship complete solutions with error handling, monitoring, and observability. When I deliver a system, you can deploy it to production the same day.

WORKING STYLE

I work async-first with daily written updates in Slack or email. You'll always know what's shipping, what's blocked, and what's next. I'm based in PST (UTC-8) with 4-hour daily overlap for US East Coast teams (9 AM - 1 PM EST) and flexible 2-hour windows for European clients.

I default to over-communication: progress reports, architecture diagrams, and decision documentation. Nothing gets lost. I identify blockers proactively and propose solutions before they escalate.

PROVEN EXPERIENCE

- Real Estate AI: Multi-agent chatbot system managing $50M+ sales pipeline with intelligent lead qualification, buyer/seller bots, A/B testing, and CRM sync (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce)
- Document Intelligence: RAG pipeline processing 1,000+ page PDFs with hybrid retrieval, citation scoring, and sub-2-second response times
- Data Analytics: Streamlit platforms with forecasting, clustering, anomaly detection, SHAP explainability, serving CSV-to-dashboard workflows
