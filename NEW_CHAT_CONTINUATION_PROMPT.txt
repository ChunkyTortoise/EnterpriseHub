STREAM C EVALUATION & COURSE CORRECTION

I need to evaluate Stream C Mobile & Export Features implementation for Jorge's Real Estate AI Dashboard. There's concern about potential scope drift from original requirements.

CRITICAL OBJECTIVES:
1. Read foundational documents to understand what Stream C was supposed to deliver
2. Audit current state - evaluate what was delivered vs. requested
3. Identify gaps between architecture and actual implementation
4. Course-correct to deliver working functionality, not just documentation

EVALUATION FOCUS:
- Does the dashboard actually work better on mobile now?
- Is there working export functionality with professional output?
- Did we create architectural specs instead of working code?
- What quick implementations can improve user experience immediately?

PRIORITY FILES TO READ (in order):
1. CLAUDE.md - Project architecture and instructions
2. SPECIFICATION.md - Core project specifications
3. command_center/dashboard_v2.py - Current production dashboard
4. command_center/components/export_manager.py - Current export functionality
5. STREAM_C_MOBILE_EXPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md - What was just delivered
6. CRITICAL_FILES_FOR_EVALUATION.md - Complete file reading list

EVALUATION QUESTIONS:
- What was Stream C originally supposed to accomplish?
- What did we actually deliver (working code vs. documentation)?
- Is the mobile experience noticeably improved?
- Does export functionality actually work?
- What can be implemented immediately to provide value?

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
Clear gap analysis and actionable plan to deliver what was actually needed for Stream C, with focus on working code over documentation.

USE AGENTS STRATEGICALLY:
- Explore agent to survey existing codebase
- Code architect to evaluate integration issues
- General purpose for documentation analysis
- DO NOT create more architecture without implementing

START WITH: Read CLAUDE.md and SPECIFICATION.md to understand original project scope and requirements.
