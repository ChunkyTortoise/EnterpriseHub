# Quick Continuation Prompt

**Copy this into a new Claude Code chat:**

---

I need to continue working on Jorge's Real Estate AI Platform. We just completed the Next.js frontend migration (from research recommendations) and need to connect it to the production FastAPI backend.

**CURRENT STATUS:**
✅ Next.js frontend running at http://localhost:3000/jorge
✅ Professional UI components built (chat, dashboard, real-time)
✅ Integration layer ready (jorge-api-client.ts, chat store)
✅ 75% of research recommendations implemented

**NEXT:** Connect frontend to Jorge's production LangGraph bot ecosystem (needs `pip install PyJWT` for backend startup).

**Key files:** `/enterprise-ui/` (complete platform), `INTEGRATION_STATUS_SUMMARY.md` (details)
