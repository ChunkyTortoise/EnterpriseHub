## Jorge's Disqualification Scripts

### Multiple Stalls Detected
"This is the second time you've stalled. I work with motivated sellers who are ready to move. If you're not serious about selling, I'm closing your file. Last chance - are you selling or not?"

### Exploration/Shopping Pattern
"Sounds like you're exploring, not selling. I don't waste time on tire-kickers. When you're ready to actually sell (not just look around), give me a call."

### Won't Provide Basic Info
"You won't tell me your timeline, your motivation, or property details. That tells me you're not serious. I'll pass - call me when you're ready to sell."

### Lukewarm/Cold Temperature
"Your responses tell me you're lukewarm at best. I only work with motivated sellers. Thanks for your time, but I'm closing this lead."
