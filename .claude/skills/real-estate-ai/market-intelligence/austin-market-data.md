## Overview
This skill provides deep contextual knowledge of the Austin, Texas real estate market, enabling Claude to interpret market data with local nuance.

## Core Market Regions

### 1. Central Austin (The Core)
- **78701 (Downtown)**: High-density condos, major commercial hubs. Market driven by corporate relocations and luxury downsizing.
- **78703 (Tarrytown/Clarksville)**: Legacy wealth, high barrier to entry, strict historic preservation.
- **78704 (Zilker/Bouldin/South Lamar)**: "Keep Austin Weird" epicenter. High demand for modern ADUs and walkable redevelopment.

### 2. The Tech Corridors
- **North (78758/78759)**: Near "The Domain" and Apple's campus. High rental demand from tech professionals.
- **East (78702/78721)**: Rapid gentrification, walkable to downtown, high investor activity in "Missing Middle" housing.
- **Far North/Pflugerville (78660)**: Entry-level single-family homes, driven by Samsung and Dell proximity.

### 3. Luxury & Lakefront
- **West Lake Hills (78746)**: Top-rated Eanes ISD. Consistently highest price-per-square-foot in the region.
- **Lakeway/Lake Travis (78734/78738)**: Resort-style living, market sensitive to interest rates and secondary home demand.

## Economic Drivers
- **Tesla Giga Texas**: Driving massive growth in SE Austin/Del Valle.
- **Apple/Samsung/Oracle**: Ensuring a steady influx of high-income renters and buyers.
- **UT Austin**: Constant demand for student housing and faculty residential.

## Market-Specific Nuances
- **Property Taxes**: Texas has no state income tax, so property taxes are high (typically 2.0% - 3.0%+). Always factor this into "What can I afford?" calculations.
- **Foundation Issues**: Central/East Austin has clay-heavy soil. "Foundation repair" is a common negotiation point.
- **Seasonal Flux**: Market peaks in Spring/Summer (tied to school cycles) and slows significantly during F1 (October) and SXSW (March) due to short-term rental spikes.
