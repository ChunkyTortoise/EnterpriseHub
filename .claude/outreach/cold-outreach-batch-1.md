## Personalized Emails (10)

### Email 1: Wayline

**Subject**: Your AI front desk + RAG-powered property knowledge — a thought

Hi Jason,

I saw Wayline's YC launch — an AI front desk that handles calls and messages 24/7 for property managers is exactly the kind of vertical AI that wins. The combination of your WeWork and Jupe experience with repeat-founder AI expertise is compelling.

One challenge I've seen with conversational AI in real estate: property-specific knowledge retrieval at scale. I built a RAG pipeline for a real estate platform that manages a $50M+ pipeline — it delivers property-specific answers with <200ms overhead and 89% LLM cost reduction through 3-tier caching.

If Wayline is looking to deepen property knowledge retrieval or scale conversation quality, I could bring production-ready RAG infrastructure that's already tested with 8,500+ automated tests.

Would 15 minutes make sense to see if there's a fit?

### Email 2: PARES AI

**Subject**: Shipping AI features faster with a 3-person team

Hi Zihao,

Congrats on getting PARES into YC S25 — building the all-in-one AI platform for CRE brokers is a massive opportunity. Your combo of MIT CS/AI plus managing $500M+ in real estate deals gives you a rare edge.

With a 3-person team, every engineering hour matters. I specialize in production AI systems for real estate — RAG pipelines, lead qualification, CRM integrations — all shipping with tests, docs, and deployment configs. Recent work: 4.3M tool dispatches/sec in a multi-agent system, 89% LLM cost reduction.

I could help PARES ship its AI features 2-3x faster without the overhead of a full-time hire. Happy to start with a focused 2-week sprint on your highest-priority AI module.

Worth a quick call?

Best,
Cayman Roden

### Email 3: Cambio

**Subject**: Agentic AI at scale — multi-agent orchestration that actually works

Hi Leon,

Congrats on the $18M Series A — Cambio's agentic AI approach to CRE operations is the right bet. Having been an early Faire engineer, you know what it takes to build platforms that scale.

I noticed Cambio is leaning heavily into agentic AI. I built AgentForge, a multi-agent orchestration framework that handles 4.3M tool dispatches/sec with <200ms overhead and automatic governance/routing. It's tested with 8,500+ automated tests and includes audit trails — critical for CRE compliance.

If your engineering team is scaling agent infrastructure, I could bring production-tested patterns for agent coordination, context preservation, and cost optimization (89% LLM cost reduction via intelligent caching).

Would you be open to a 15-minute architecture chat?

Best,

### Email 4: Luxury Presence

**Subject**: Bridging your 300% AI team expansion — production AI contractor

Hi Jesse,

Impressive growth at Luxury Presence — $75M ARR and 300% AI team expansion since January 2025. Scaling engineering that fast while maintaining quality is one of the hardest challenges in tech.

While you're ramping up full-time hires, I can help bridge critical AI workstreams immediately. I build production real estate AI systems: lead qualification engines, conversational AI for agent marketing, and RAG-powered content generation — all with comprehensive tests and deployment configs.

Relevant proof points: 3 CRM integrations (including GoHighLevel), temperature-based lead scoring, and 5 live Streamlit demos. Everything ships production-ready.

Would it help to discuss which AI workstreams could benefit from contractor support while you scale?

### Email 5: Cherre

**Subject**: Agent.STUDIO + battle-tested multi-agent infrastructure

Hi Misha,

Cherre's Agent.STUDIO launch caught my attention — an AI platform built specifically for real estate's data complexity is exactly what the market needs. Managing $3.3T AUM with agentic AI is ambitious and exciting.

I've built production multi-agent systems with similar architectural goals: governance, routing, auto-scaling, and audit trails. My platform handles 4.3M dispatches/sec, includes 22 specialized agents, and achieves 89% cost reduction through intelligent 3-tier caching.

With Cherre hiring 30-50 people including ML/data science roles, I could start contributing immediately on agent orchestration, RAG pipelines, or knowledge graph integrations — no 3-month ramp-up needed.

Worth 15 minutes to explore the overlap?

### Email 6: Restb.ai

**Subject**: Adding NLP/RAG capabilities to your computer vision platform

Hi Angel,

Restb.ai's position as the leading visual intelligence provider for real estate is well-earned. As you expand beyond computer vision into broader property intelligence, there's a natural opportunity to layer in NLP and knowledge retrieval.

I specialize in the other side of AI for real estate — RAG pipelines, conversational AI, and document processing. My document Q&A system handles complex real estate documents with semantic search and achieves <200ms response times. Everything is production-grade with 8,500+ tests.

Combining Restb.ai's visual intelligence with NLP-powered property knowledge could create a comprehensive AI property platform. I could build complementary modules that integrate cleanly with your existing architecture.

Would a brief call make sense to explore this?

### Email 7: Hostaway

**Subject**: Scaling AI guest messaging from 93% to 99% automation

Hi there,

Hostaway's growth is remarkable — a PMS unicorn with $365M in funding and AI that automates 93% of guest messaging. Getting from 93% to 99%+ is where production AI engineering matters most.

I build conversational AI and intelligent automation systems for real estate. Recent work includes multi-agent orchestration (4.3M dispatches/sec), RAG-powered knowledge retrieval, and dynamic ML pipelines — all with the reliability that comes from 8,500+ automated tests and <200ms overhead.

For Hostaway specifically, I could help with: advanced intent classification for edge-case guest queries, RAG-powered property-specific knowledge, and cost-optimized LLM routing that reduces AI spend by up to 89%.

Would your AI team be open to a quick chat about pushing automation rates higher?
