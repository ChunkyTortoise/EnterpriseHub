## Premium Pricing Strategy

### Value-Based Pricing Psychology

#### ROI-Driven Pricing Model

**Traditional IT Project Pricing**: Cost-plus model (hours × rate + margin)
**Our Premium Pricing**: Value-creation model (business impact × risk adjustment)

**Pricing Calculation Framework**:
```
Base Value = Quantified Business Impact (3-year projection)
Risk Adjustment = Complexity multiplier (1.2x - 2.0x)
Market Premium = Competitive differentiation factor (1.3x - 1.8x)
Final Price = (Base Value × Risk Adjustment × Market Premium) × 15-25%

Example: $50M business impact × 1.5 risk × 1.5 premium × 20% = $2.25M
```

#### Pricing Tier Optimization

**Foundation Tier** ($300K - $600K):
- **Target**: Proof-of-concept and initial enterprise entry
- **Scope**: Single business unit or department
- **Risk**: Limited scope reduces client risk
- **Outcome**: Foundation for expansion engagements

**Enterprise Tier** ($600K - $1.5M):
- **Target**: Company-wide transformation initiatives
- **Scope**: Multiple business units with integration requirements
- **Risk**: Managed through phased delivery approach
- **Outcome**: Comprehensive business intelligence platform

**Strategic Tier** ($1.5M - $5M):
- **Target**: Multi-year transformation partnerships
- **Scope**: Portfolio company optimization or industry-wide initiatives
- **Risk**: Mitigated through guaranteed outcome models
