# Talking Points: Initial Call with Jorge (Lyrio.io)

## 1. The Opening (Positioning)
*   "I’ve spent time looking at Lyrio. You’ve done a great job building a vertical-specific CRM. Most people just white-label GHL and change the logo; you’re actually trying to solve the Real Estate lead problem."
*   "My background is in building the 'glue' that makes these systems actually intelligent—custom middleware, AI scoring, and data automation."

## 2. Discovery Questions (Finding the Pain)
*   **On Leads:** "GHL is great at capturing leads, but how much 'junk' are your users dealing with? Are you currently using any custom sentiment analysis to separate 'just looking' from 'ready to buy'?"
*   **On Automation:** "Are you running into any GHL API limitations? Usually, when you scale past a certain point, the native workflows get messy or slow."
*   **On Competition:** "What's the #1 feature your users are asking for that GHL doesn't do natively?"

## 3. Explaining Your Value (The "Technical Force Multiplier")
*   "I prefer working on a project basis because it aligns us on results. You don't want to pay for my hours; you want to pay for a feature that helps you retain users or charge more for Lyrio."
*   "I focus on 'The Final 10%'—the custom logic that competitors can't just copy by buying a GHL subscription."

## 4. Closing the "Diagnostic" ($250 Audit)
*   "Instead of guessing where to start, I recommend we do a **Technical Diagnostic**. I'll spend a few hours under the hood of your current setup."
*   "I'll look for cost-saving opportunities (LLM token optimization) and performance bottlenecks. I’ll give you a Roadmap PDF of exactly what needs to be built."
*   "It’s $250, and if we move forward on any of the projects I identify, I’ll credit that $250 back to the first build. It's basically a free audit if we work together."

## 5. Handling the "Budget" Conversation
*   **If he says you're expensive:** "I understand. That’s why I offer the **Growth Partner** model (Option 2). We can do a lower base retainer, and I’ll take a performance bonus based on the revenue or cost-savings I actually generate for Lyrio. If I don't make you money, I don't get the bonus."
