# Consultative Sales Framework: Strategic Call with Jorge (Lyrio.io)

## 1. Establishing Architectural Authority
*   "I’ve performed a preliminary review of Lyrio’s current market positioning. You’ve moved beyond a standard white-label GHL play; you’re building a vertical-specific operating system for Real Estate. That requires a shift from 'configuration' to 'engineering'."
*   "My focus is on **Technical Governance**—ensuring that as Lyrio scales, the AI logic remains proprietary, secure, and performant."

## 2. Strategic Discovery (Identifying Value Gaps)
*   **On Scalability:** "GHL’s native workflows are excellent for basic automation, but they often become a bottleneck for high-volume brokerages. Where are you seeing the most latency or 'silent failures' in your current automation stack?"
*   **On Data Moats:** "In the current AI landscape, the UI is a commodity. The real 'moat' is in how you process unstructured data. Are you capturing the semantic intent of your leads (budget sensitivity, motivation level) and storing that as structured IP in your CRM?"
*   **On Competitive Wedge:** "What is the #1 feature request from your 'Power Users' that currently requires a manual workaround or a messy third-party integration?"

## 3. Positioning the "Technical Force Multiplier"
*   "I operate as an extension of your leadership team. My goal is to build the **Proprietary Middle-Tier**—the logic that lives *between* GHL and the LLMs—which ensures that even if a competitor copies your GHL setup, they can't replicate Lyrio’s intelligence."
*   "I prefer value-based pricing because it aligns our incentives. If I build a feature that reduces churn by 10% or allows you to upcharge for a 'Premium AI' tier, my compensation should be a reflection of that business outcome."

## 4. The "Diagnostic" Close ($250 Audit)
*   "Rather than guessing at the next feature, I recommend starting with a **Technical Diagnostic**. I'll perform an architectural audit of your current stack to identify 'leaks'—both in lead conversion and in API/LLM costs."
*   "The deliverable is a **Prioritized Scalability Roadmap**. It's a $250 investment that I fully credit back toward our first build engagement. It effectively makes the discovery phase risk-free for Lyrio."

## 5. Navigating the Budget Discussion
*   "If the immediate cash burn is a concern, we should look at the **Strategic Systems Optimization** model. We keep the base retainer manageable, and I participate in the upside through a performance bonus tied to the cost savings or new revenue my architecture generates."
*   "My goal is to be a profit center for Lyrio, not a line-item expense."
