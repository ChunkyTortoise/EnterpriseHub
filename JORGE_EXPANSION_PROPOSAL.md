**Prepared for:** Jorge Salas
**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Developer:** Cayman

---

## Executive Summary
Following the successful implementation of Phase 1 (The Core AI Brain), we are ready to expand the system into a full-cycle **Conversion Engine**. This proposal outlines the next 3 phases designed to automate property matching, empower buyers with self-service tools, and ensure no lead goes cold through intelligent follow-ups.

## Phase 2: Smart Property Matching
**Goal:** Automate the "Search" process by connecting buyer criteria directly to your inventory.

- **Functionality:**
    - AI cross-references extracted lead preferences (budget, beds, location) with your listings.
    - Automated SMS "Matches" sent to leads with listing links.
    - Manual listing upload system (or MLS API integration prep).
- **Timeframe:** 7 Days
- **Market Value:** $2,500
- **Your Price:** **$1,950**

## Phase 3: Self-Service Buyer Portal
**Goal:** Increase lead engagement and data accuracy by giving buyers a personalized dashboard.

- **Functionality:**
    - Unique personal link for every lead (e.g., `portal.jorgesalas.ai/l/sarah-johnson`).
    - Mobile-friendly UI for leads to adjust their own criteria (budget, beds, etc.).
    - Real-time sync: Changes made in the portal instantly update GHL custom fields.
- **Timeframe:** 10 Days
- **Market Value:** $3,500
- **Your Price:** **$2,750**

## Phase 4: Intelligent Follow-Up & Nurture
**Goal:** Lifecycle automation that re-engages leads based on market events.

- **Functionality:**
    - "New Listing" Alerts: AI texts leads when a home hitting the market matches their saved criteria.
    - "Price Drop" Triggers: Automated re-engagement if a previously viewed home drops in price.
    - Cold Lead Reactivation: Conversational bots that "check in" with leads who haven't responded in 30 days.
- **Timeframe:** 5 Days
- **Market Value:** $1,500
- **Your Price:** **$1,150**
