Hi Jorge,

I’m excited to share that **Phases 1 (Leads)** and **2 (Sellers)** of the Real Estate AI Platform are now 100% complete, verified, and ready for production use. 

The core "AI Brain" is now operational—handling lead qualification scoring (0-100) and managing your property knowledge base (RAG) with institutional-grade accuracy.

### 🚀 What’s Next: Phase 3 (The Matching & Demand Engine)
Now that we have the leads and the inventory, we are ready to close the loop. Phase 3 focuses on the **Conversion Engine**:

1.  **AI Matchmaker:** An automated algorithm that cross-references buyer criteria against your listings in real-time.
2.  **The Buyer Portal:** A premium, branded, mobile-first experience for leads (no app download required).
3.  **Direct Booking:** One-click showing requests that sync directly to your GHL Calendar.

### 💎 Founding Partner Pricing Reminder
As we discussed, this full suite is being delivered at the **Founding Partner Rate of $3,500** (a $9,000+ discount vs. standard agency rates). 

*   **Total Project:** $3,500
*   **Paid to Date:** $2,000 (Phase 1 & 2)
*   **Phase 3 Kickoff:** $1,000
*   **Final Delivery (Phase 4):** $500

I’ve attached the updated **Master Services Agreement** which now reflects my "Senior AI Architect" credentials (including my recent 1,768 hours of specialized training from Google, IBM, and Vanderbilt). This ensures the system we are building for Lyrio is competitive with the top-tier enterprise platforms in the market.

**Next Step:** Let’s hop on a 5-minute call today or tomorrow to walkthrough the Phase 3 demo and get the kickoff started.

Best,

Cayman
