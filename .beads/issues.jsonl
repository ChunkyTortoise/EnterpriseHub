The first message's extraction was lost entirely, causing it to re-ask Q1 even though motivation was clearly stated.\n\n**Reproduction**: POST /test/seller twice simultaneously with the same contact_id.\n\n**Fix approach**: Wrap conversation state read-modify-write in a per-contact async lock (asyncio.Lock keyed by contact_id) or use optimistic locking with a version field.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-25T15:00:11Z","updated_at":"2026-03-02T05:50:47Z","closed_at":"2026-03-02T05:50:47Z","close_reason":"Already fixed: JorgeSellerEngine._contact_locks: ClassVar[Dict[str, asyncio.Lock]] = {} (line 121) serialises per-contact requests via async with _lock in process_seller_response (lines 188-191).
