I built what would cost $24,000 at Bloomberg - for free.

Bloomberg Terminal charges $2,000/month for market data and technical analysis.

I replicated the core features in Python:

📊 4-Panel Technical Analysis:
- Candlestick charts with moving averages
- RSI indicator (overbought/oversold signals)
- MACD histogram (momentum tracking)
- Volume analysis (green/red bars)

🔧 Built with:
- Python + Streamlit (web framework)
- yfinance (real-time data)
- ta library (technical indicators)
- Plotly (interactive charts)

💰 Cost comparison:

#### Proposal #2: Campaign ROI Tracking Tool

**When to Use:** Jobs focused on "ROI calculation", "profit tracking", "conversion metrics"
**Attach:** `marketing-analytics-roi-heatmap.png`
**Time to Customize:** 3 minutes
**Estimated Response Time:** 5 minutes

**Copy & Customize:**

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

ROI tracking shouldn't take 2 hours per campaign. I automated it.

I built a Marketing Analytics platform with a dedicated ROI Calculator module that does what you're asking for:

**What It Does:**
1. Input campaign data (spend, visitors, conversions, average order value)
2. Instantly calculate:
   - ROI percentage
   - ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
   - CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
   - Profit margin

3. Scenario modeling - the real differentiator:
   - Interactive heatmap showing profit at every conversion rate and order value combination
   - Test 100 scenarios simultaneously
   - Visual color-coding: red (loss) → yellow (break-even) → green (profit)

**Why This Matters:**
Instead of manually calculating "what if our conversion rate improves to 3%?" - you see all scenarios at once. Makes budget allocation decisions obvious.

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/
(Select "Marketing Analytics" → "ROI Calculator" tab)

**Screenshot attached:** Heatmap showing 100 profit scenarios

**For Your Project:**
[REPLACE WITH SPECIFIC DETAIL - e.g., "You track spending across Google Ads, Facebook, and email. I'll build data connectors for each platform with automatic daily updates"]

I can customize this to:
- Pull data from your [PLATFORM] automatically
- Add your specific KPIs
- Brand it with your company colors/logo
- Export reports in your preferred format

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME - e.g., "1.5 weeks"] - I've already built the core, so this is adapting existing code.

**Cost Context:**
- Agencies charge $200-500/month for similar dashboards
- This is a one-time build you own forever

**Certifications:**
- Google Digital Marketing & E-commerce (190 hrs)
- Meta Social Media Marketing Professional (83 hrs)
- Microsoft Generative AI for Data Analysis (108 hrs)

What channels are you currently tracking? I'll propose the best data integration approach.

Best,
Cayman

#### Proposal #3: A/B Testing Significance Calculator

**When to Use:** Jobs asking for "A/B test tools", "split testing", "statistical analysis"
**Attach:** `marketing-analytics-ab-test.png`
**Time to Customize:** 3 minutes
**Estimated Response Time:** 5 minutes

**Copy & Customize:**

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

Stop guessing. Start knowing with 95% confidence.

I built an A/B testing significance calculator that uses the same statistical methods as Optimizely and VWO - but it's tailored to your needs.

**What It Does:**

**For 2-Variant Tests (A vs B):**
- Z-test for proportions
- Calculates p-value, confidence level, and winner determination
- Shows sample size recommendations for desired confidence

**For Multi-Variant Tests (A/B/C/D):**
- Chi-square test
- Identifies best performer across all variants
- Handles up to 10 variants simultaneously

**Example from My Platform:**
Test: Variant A (1,000 visitors, 50 conversions) vs Variant B (1,000 visitors, 65 conversions)
Result: Variant B wins with 97.7% confidence (p-value: 0.023)

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/
(Select "Marketing Analytics" → "A/B Testing" tab)

**Screenshot attached:** Test results showing 97.7% confidence

**Technical Depth:**
Uses `scipy.stats` under the hood - the industry standard for statistical computing. This is what paid tools use, but you'd own the code.

**For Your Project:**
[REPLACE WITH SPECIFIC DETAIL - e.g., "You're testing checkout flows and email subject lines. I'll build a tool that integrates with your analytics platform and flags winners automatically"]

I can add:
- Sequential testing (check results as data comes in)
- Bayesian statistics (faster decision-making)
- Integration with your [ANALYTICS_PLATFORM]
- Automated alerts when significance is reached

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME - e.g., "1-2 weeks"] for standalone tool, or I can integrate into your existing dashboard.

**Why This Matters:**
Bad A/B test interpretation costs money. I've seen teams:
- Call winners too early (not enough data)
- Run tests too long (opportunity cost)
- Misunderstand confidence levels

This eliminates guesswork.

Ready to discuss your testing workflow. What platforms are you testing on?

Best,
Cayman

**Attach:** `marketing-analytics-attribution.png`
**Time to Customize:** 3 minutes
**Estimated Response Time:** 5 minutes

**Copy & Customize:**

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

Which touchpoints actually drive conversions? I built 5 attribution models to find out.

**The Problem:**
You're spending across multiple channels (Paid Search, Paid Social, Email, Organic), but which touchpoints deserve credit for the sale?

**My Solution:**
Attribution Modeling module with 5 industry-standard models:

**1. First-Touch Attribution**
- 100% credit to first touchpoint
- Use case: Brand awareness campaigns

**2. Last-Touch Attribution**
- 100% credit to last touchpoint before conversion
- Use case: Direct response campaigns

**3. Linear Attribution**
- Equal credit to all touchpoints
- Use case: Multi-channel strategies

**4. Time-Decay Attribution**
- More credit to touchpoints closer to conversion
- Use case: Long sales cycles

**5. Position-Based Attribution (U-shaped)**
- 40% to first, 40% to last, 20% distributed to middle
- Use case: Complex customer journeys

**Visual Comparison:**
Side-by-side view of how each model allocates credit - makes channel optimization decisions obvious.

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/
(Select "Marketing Analytics" → "Attribution Modeling" tab)

**Screenshot attached:** Attribution breakdown across 5 models

**For Your Project:**
[REPLACE WITH SPECIFIC DETAIL - e.g., "You have 4 touchpoints (SEM, Display, Email, Organic) before most conversions. I'll model these to show which channels to prioritize in budget allocation"]

I can:
- Connect this to your actual customer journey data
- Add custom attribution models (W-shaped, Z-shaped)
- Integrate with [YOUR_CRM/ANALYTICS_PLATFORM]
- Calculate channel-specific ROI based on attribution
- Build reports showing optimal budget allocation

**Real-World Impact:**
One of my test scenarios showed that switching from Last-Touch to Position-Based attribution changed channel ROI rankings by 30% - that's a 6-figure budget reallocation decision.

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME - e.g., "2-3 weeks"]] for data integration and customization.

**Certifications:**
- IBM Business Intelligence Analyst Professional Certificate (141 hrs)
- Google Data Analytics Certificate (181 hrs)
- Meta Social Media Marketing Professional Certificate (83 hrs)

Ready to discuss your current attribution approach. What channels are you trying to optimize?

**Attach:** `content-engine-output.png`, `data-detective-ai.png`
**Time to Customize:** 3 minutes
**Estimated Response Time:** 5 minutes

**Copy & Customize:**

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

I've integrated Claude API into 3 production modules with retry logic and cost optimization.

**My Experience:**

**Module 1: Content Engine**
- Generates LinkedIn posts using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- 6 templates, 5 tone options, dynamic prompt construction
- Exponential backoff retry decorator for rate limits
- Cost: $0.003 per post (vs $50-150 for human writers)

**Module 2: Data Detective**
- AI-powered data insights from CSV/Excel uploads
- Natural language queries: users ask questions, AI answers based on their data
- Handles structured data context efficiently (summarizes large datasets)

**Module 3: Agent Logic (Sentiment Scout)**
- Sentiment analysis of financial news
- Combines traditional NLP with Claude for nuanced market sentiment
- Returns scores (-100 to +100) with reasoning

**Technical Patterns I've Implemented:**

**1. Graceful Degradation:**
```python
try:
    from anthropic import Anthropic
    ANTHROPIC_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    ANTHROPIC_AVAILABLE = False
```
App works without API, but shows upgrade option.

**2. Retry Logic:**
```python
@retry_with_exponential_backoff(max_attempts=3, initial_delay=1.0)
def _call_claude_api(client, prompt):
    # Handles RateLimitError, APIConnectionError, APITimeoutError
    # Never retries on auth errors
```

**3. Session-Based API Keys:**
```python
api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    api_key = st.session_state.get("anthropic_api_key")
```
No hardcoded credentials, secure handling.

**4. Cost Optimization:**
- Cache common prompts using Streamlit's `@st.cache_data`
- Limit max_tokens to prevent runaway costs
- Show estimated cost before generation

**5. Error Handling:**
Clear user messages for:
- Invalid API keys
- Rate limit exceeded
- Network timeouts
- Service outages

#### Proposal #9: Streamlit Dashboard Development

**When to Use:** Jobs specifically asking for "Streamlit development"
**Attach:** 2-3 module screenshots
**Time to Customize:** 3 minutes
**Estimated Response Time:** 5 minutes

**Copy & Customize:**

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

7 modules. 220+ tests. Live deployment. I know Streamlit.

**EnterpriseHub** is my flagship Streamlit project - a production-grade platform proving I can build what you need.

**What I've Built:**

**Architecture:**
- Multi-page navigation with dynamic module loading
- 7 independent modules (no cross-imports for maintainability)
- Shared utilities layer (data_loader, logger, exceptions)
- Session state management for persistence across reruns

**Module Complexity Examples:**

**Marketing Analytics (1,167 lines):**
- 6 tabs with complex visualizations
- Statistical testing (scipy.stats)
- Interactive Plotly charts
- CSV/Excel export

**Data Detective (24,372 lines):**
- File upload handling (CSV/Excel)
- AI integration (Claude API)
- 5-tab interface
- Natural language queries

**Content Engine (23,339 lines):**
- Dynamic form inputs
- API integration with retry logic
- Character count validation
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality

**Technical Patterns I Use:**

**1. Caching Strategy:**
```python
@st.cache_data(ttl=300)
def get_stock_data(ticker, period):
    # Expensive operations cached for 5 minutes
```

**2. Session State Management:**
```python
if "generated_post" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.generated_post = None
```

**3. Multi-Column Layouts:**
```python
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns([1, 2, 1])
with col1:
    # Controls
with col2:
    # Main content
```

**4. Custom Exception Handling:**
- EnterpriseHubError base class
- DataFetchError, InvalidTickerError, etc.
- User-friendly error messages with action tips

**5. Plotly Integration:**
- Subplots with custom row heights
- Interactive hover tooltips
- Professional color schemes

**Production Quality:**
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- 220+ automated tests (pytest)
- Type hints throughout
- Pre-commit hooks (Black, isort, Flake8, mypy)
- Deployed on Streamlit Cloud

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/
Browse all 7 modules to see different UI patterns.

**For Your Project:**
[REPLACE WITH SPECIFIC DETAIL - e.g., "You need a dashboard for real-time inventory tracking with multi-tab navigation and export functionality. I'll build this using proven Streamlit patterns"]

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME - e.g., "2-3 weeks"]] - I work fast because I've solved common Streamlit challenges already.

**What I Deliver:**
- Clean, maintainable code
- Comprehensive documentation
- Automated tests
- Deployment support (Streamlit Cloud, Docker, AWS)

**Certifications:**
- 10 completed certifications (~930 hours total)
- Focus: AI, Data Analytics, Python development

Full source code available: https://github.com/ChunkyTortoise/enterprise-hub
