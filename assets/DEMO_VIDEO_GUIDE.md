## Recording Best Practices

### Audio Tips
1. **Speak 20% slower** than normal conversation (clarity over speed)
2. **Pause 0.5 seconds** between sentences (easier to edit)
3. **Emphasize KEY WORDS:**
   - "$24,000 at Bloomberg"
   - "100 pricing scenarios"
   - "2 minutes instead of 2 hours"
   - "220 automated tests"
   - "$0.003 per post"

4. **Vocal Energy:**
   - Start HIGH energy (hook)
   - Maintain MEDIUM energy (demos)
   - End HIGH energy (CTA)

5. **Avoid Filler Words:**
   - Don't say "um", "uh", "like", "you know"
   - If you mess up, pause 2 seconds, restart sentence (easy to edit)

### Visual Tips
1. **Cursor Movement:**
   - Move cursor SLOWLY (jerky cursor looks unprofessional)
   - Hide cursor when showing visuals (press F11 for fullscreen)

2. **Transitions:**
   - Sidebar clicks should be VISIBLE (don't cut too fast)
   - Wait 0.5 seconds after page loads before continuing

3. **Loading Screens:**
   - Keep loading spinners IN the video (shows it's real)
   - But no longer than 2 seconds (speed up in editing if needed)

4. **Text Readability:**
   - All text must be readable at 1080p
   - If text too small, zoom in (150-200%)

---

## Recording Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Do a Full Rehearsal (10 minutes)
1. Navigate through all 7 modules (no recording)
2. Verify inputs are pre-filled (Margin Hunter, Content Engine, etc.)
3. Ensure API key is entered (Content Engine, Data Detective)
4. Practice transitions (sidebar clicks should be smooth)
5. Time yourself: Should be 50-60 seconds

### Step 2: Record Full Take (10-15 minutes)
1. Start screen recording software
2. Click record audio + screen
3. Take 3 deep breaths (reduces nervousness)
4. Start narration + demo

**Expected:** You'll need 2-4 takes. That's normal.

**Common Issues:**
- Take 1: Audio too quiet (adjust mic)
- Take 2: Spoke too fast (slow down)
- Take 3: Module didn't load (wait longer)
- Take 4: Perfect! ✓

### Step 3: Review Raw Recording (5 minutes)
- [ ] Audio clear? (no background noise, no pops)
- [ ] All visuals visible? (no blank screens)
- [ ] Timing correct? (55-65 seconds)
- [ ] Narration smooth? (no long pauses or stumbles)

If NO to any: Re-record problem section only, splice in editing.

## Post-Production (Light Editing - 15 minutes)

### Editing Checklist

**Tool Options:**
- **Easy:** Loom (built-in editor), iMovie (Mac), Windows Video Editor (PC)
- **Pro:** DaVinci Resolve (free), Adobe Premiere Pro

### Edits to Make:

1. **Trim Intro/Outro:**
   - Cut 2-3 seconds before you start speaking
   - Cut immediately after "Full source code on GitHub"

2. **Add Captions (Highly Recommended):**
   - 80% of LinkedIn videos watched with sound OFF
   - Use: Kapwing (auto-captions, free), Rev.com ($1/min), or manual
   - Font: Sans-serif, white text with black outline
   - Size: Large (1/4 screen height)

3. **Add Text Overlays:**
   - At 0:02: "$24,000 at Bloomberg" (emphasize hook)
   - At 0:10: "100 scenarios" (over heatmap)
   - At 0:30: "2 min vs 2 hours" (over Data Detective)
   - At 0:40: "$0.003 per post" (over Content Engine)
   - At 0:50: "220+ tests, 85% coverage" (over GitHub)
   - At 0:57: "github.com/ChunkyTortoise/enterprise-hub"

4. **Speed Adjustments:**
   - If loading screen >2 seconds: Speed up to 2x
   - If total video >65 seconds: Speed up slow sections to 1.2x

5. **Audio Enhancements:**
   - Normalize audio levels (all speech same volume)
   - Remove background noise (if any)
   - Compress audio (reduce dynamic range for consistent listening)

6. **Add Background Music (Optional):**
   - Use: YouTube Audio Library, Epidemic Sound, or Artlist
   - Volume: -20dB (very quiet, should not distract from narration)
   - Style: Upbeat, tech-focused (not dramatic)

### Export Settings
- **Format:** MP4 (H.264 codec)
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 (1080p)
- **Frame Rate:** 30 FPS
- **Bitrate:** 5-8 Mbps (good quality, reasonable file size)
- **File Size Target:** Under 50 MB (LinkedIn limit is 5 GB, but smaller uploads faster)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Audio quality poor
**Solution:**
- Use headphone mic (built-in laptop mics are bad)
- Or use phone as external mic (voice memo app → AirDrop)
- Or buy: Blue Yeti ($100) or Rode NT-USB ($169)

### Issue: Screen recording laggy
**Solution:**
- Close all other apps (especially Chrome with many tabs)
- Record at 720p instead of 1080p, upscale in editing
- Use OBS Studio (more efficient than QuickTime)

### Issue: File size too large
**Solution:**
- Use Handbrake (free) to compress: Target 5-8 Mbps bitrate
- Or use online tool: CloudConvert, FreeConvert

### Issue: Modules not loading fast
**Solution:**
- Record late at night / early morning (less Streamlit Cloud traffic)
- Or pre-load all modules in browser tabs before recording
- Speed up loading screens in editing (2x speed)

### Issue: Voice sounds nervous
**Solution:**
- Practice script 5+ times (muscle memory)
- Smile while talking (sounds more confident)
- Stand up while recording (better breath control)
- If still nervous: Record video first, add voiceover after

## Pro Tips

1. **Record in Batches:**
   - Record Scenes 1-3 in one take
   - Record Scenes 4-7 in another take
   - Splice together (easier than perfect 60-second take)

2. **Voiceover vs Live:**
   - **Live:** Record voice + screen simultaneously (feels more authentic)
   - **Voiceover:** Record screen first, add voice after (more control)
   - **Recommendation:** Try live first (faster), voiceover if issues

3. **B-Roll Footage:**
   - Record 2-3 minutes of raw footage (navigating modules)
   - Cut down to 60 seconds in editing
   - Easier than nailing perfect timing live

4. **Thumbnail Matters:**
   - YouTube/LinkedIn use first frame as thumbnail
   - Make first frame VISUALLY INTERESTING (not blank screen)
   - Or upload custom thumbnail: Use `margin-hunter-heatmap.png`

5. **Engagement Boost:**
   - Post video at 8-10 AM EST on Tuesday-Thursday
   - Reply to every comment in first hour (algorithm boost)
   - Pin your "links comment" to top

---

## Expected Results

**Week 1:**
- **YouTube:** 20-50 views (if shared on LinkedIn)
- **LinkedIn:** 200-500 views (native video = 10x engagement)
- **Upwork:** 10-30 profile views from video

**Week 2-4:**
- **YouTube:** 100-300 views (if recommended by algorithm)
- **LinkedIn:** 500-2,000 views (if shared/commented)
- **Upwork:** Increased proposal response rate (30-50% higher)

**Conversion:**
- 2-5 inbound messages from video
- 1-3 qualified leads
- Possible: 1 contract offer ($1,000-5,000)

**ROI:**
- Time invested: 2 hours (recording + editing)
- Potential return: $1,000-5,000 (one contract)
- Hourly rate: $500-2,500/hour (worth it!)
