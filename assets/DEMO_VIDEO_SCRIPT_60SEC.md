## RECORDING TIPS

### Audio Tips
1. **Speak 20% slower** than normal conversation
2. **Pause 0.5 seconds** between sentences (easier to edit)
3. **Emphasize these phrases** (speak slightly louder):
   - "$24,000 at Bloomberg"
   - "100 pricing scenarios"
   - "2 minutes instead of 2 hours"
   - "220 automated tests"
   - "$0.003 per post"

4. **Vocal Energy:**
   - Start HIGH (hook)
   - Stay MEDIUM (demos)
   - End HIGH (CTA)

5. **Avoid filler words:** No "um", "uh", "like", "you know"
   - If you mess up, pause 2 seconds and restart the sentence
   - Easy to edit out in post-production

### Visual Tips
1. **Mouse cursor:** Move slowly (jerky cursor looks bad)
2. **Transitions:** Let page load 0.5 seconds before continuing
3. **Loading screens:** Keep spinners in video (proves it's real)
4. **Text readability:** All text must be readable at 1080p

---

## RECORDING WORKFLOW

**Step 1: Do rehearsal (5 minutes)**
- Read script out loud 2 times
- Time yourself (should be 55-65 seconds)
- Navigate through all modules (no recording)
- Verify everything loads

**Step 2: Record (10 minutes)**
- Start screen recording software
- Open audio recording (microphone)
- Take 3 deep breaths
- Hit record
- Execute the script + visuals

**Expect:** You'll need 2-4 takes. That's normal. Keep going.

**Step 3: Review (5 minutes)**
- Play back raw video
- Check: Audio clear? Video smooth? Timing correct?
- If any issues, re-record that section only

---

## EDITING CHECKLIST

After recording, do these edits:

1. **Trim intro/outro:**
   - Cut 2-3 seconds BEFORE you start speaking
   - Cut immediately AFTER "Full source code on GitHub"

2. **Add captions** (HIGHLY recommended - 80% of LinkedIn videos watched muted):
   - Use Kapwing.com (free auto-captions) or manual captions
   - Font: Sans-serif, white text with black outline
   - Size: Large (1/4 of screen height)

3. **Add text overlays:**
   - 0:02: "$24,000 at Bloomberg"
   - 0:10: "100 scenarios"
   - 0:30: "2 min vs 2 hours"
   - 0:40: "$0.003 per post"
   - 0:50: "220+ tests, 85% coverage"
   - 0:57: "github.com/ChunkyTortoise/enterprise-hub"

4. **Fix any issues:**
   - If loading >2 sec: Speed up to 2x
   - If total video >65 sec: Speed up slow sections to 1.2x
   - Normalize audio levels (all speech same volume)

5. **Export settings:**
   - Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 (1080p)
   - Frame rate: 30 FPS
   - File size: Under 50 MB

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: Audio too quiet**
- Adjust microphone position (6-8 inches from mouth)
- Or use phone earbuds as mic (better quality)
- Or record again with normalized audio in editing

**Problem: Speaking too fast**
- Record again, slower pace
- Or use editing software to slow down audio to 0.9x speed

**Problem: Module takes too long to load**
- Record late at night (less Streamlit Cloud traffic)
- Or pre-load all modules in browser tabs
- Or speed up loading screen in editing (2x)

**Problem: Background noise visible**
- Use editing software to remove noise
- Or record again with windows closed

**Problem: File too large**
- Use Handbrake (free compression tool)
- Or reduce bitrate to 5 Mbps in export settings
