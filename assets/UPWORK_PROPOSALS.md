### Template 2: Campaign ROI Tracking Tool

**When to use:** Jobs focused on ROI calculation, profit tracking, conversion metrics

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

ROI tracking shouldn't take 2 hours per campaign. I automated it.

I built a Marketing Analytics platform with a dedicated ROI Calculator module that does what you're asking for:

**What It Does:**
1. Input campaign data (spend, visitors, conversions, average order value)
2. Instantly calculate:
   - ROI percentage
   - ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
   - CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
   - Profit margin

3. Scenario modeling - the real differentiator:
   - Interactive heatmap showing profit at every conversion rate and order value combination
   - Test 100 scenarios simultaneously
   - Visual color-coding: red (loss) → yellow (break-even) → green (profit)

**Why This Matters:**
Instead of manually calculating "what if our conversion rate improves to 3%?" - you see all scenarios at once. Makes budget allocation decisions obvious.

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/
(Select "Marketing Analytics" → "ROI Calculator" tab)

**Screenshot attached:** Heatmap showing 100 profit scenarios

**For Your Project:**
[SPECIFIC_DETAIL about their data sources and channels]

I can customize this to:
- Pull data from your [PLATFORM] automatically
- Add your specific KPIs
- Brand it with your company colors/logo
- Export reports in your preferred format

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME] - I've already built the core, so this is adapting existing code.

**Cost Context:**
- Agencies charge $200-500/month for similar dashboards
- This is a one-time build you own forever

**Certifications:**
- Google Digital Marketing & E-commerce (190 hrs)
- Meta Social Media Marketing Professional (83 hrs)
- Microsoft Generative AI for Data Analysis (108 hrs)

What channels are you currently tracking? I'll propose the best data integration approach.

Best,
Cayman
```

**Pricing guidance:** $1,500-2,500

### Template 3: A/B Testing Significance Calculator

**When to use:** Jobs asking for A/B test tools, split testing, statistical analysis

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

Stop guessing. Start knowing with 95% confidence.

I built an A/B testing significance calculator that uses the same statistical methods as Optimizely and VWO - but it's tailored to your needs.

**What It Does:**

**For 2-Variant Tests (A vs B):**
- Z-test for proportions
- Calculates p-value, confidence level, and winner determination
- Shows sample size recommendations for desired confidence

**For Multi-Variant Tests (A/B/C/D):**
- Chi-square test
- Identifies best performer across all variants
- Handles up to 10 variants simultaneously

**Example from My Platform:**
Test: Variant A (1,000 visitors, 50 conversions) vs Variant B (1,000 visitors, 65 conversions)
Result: Variant B wins with 97.7% confidence (p-value: 0.023)

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/
(Select "Marketing Analytics" → "A/B Testing" tab)

**Screenshot attached:** Test results showing 97.7% confidence

**Technical Depth:**
Uses `scipy.stats` under the hood - the industry standard for statistical computing. This is what paid tools use, but you'd own the code.

**For Your Project:**
[SPECIFIC_DETAIL about their testing scenarios]

I can add:
- Sequential testing (check results as data comes in)
- Bayesian statistics (faster decision-making)
- Integration with your [ANALYTICS_PLATFORM]
- Automated alerts when significance is reached

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME] for standalone tool, or I can integrate into your existing dashboard.

**Why This Matters:**
Bad A/B test interpretation costs money. I've seen teams:
- Call winners too early (not enough data)
- Run tests too long (opportunity cost)
- Misunderstand confidence levels

This eliminates guesswork.

Ready to discuss your testing workflow. What platforms are you testing on?

Best,
Cayman
```

**Pricing guidance:** $1,000-2,000

### Template 5: Marketing Attribution Modeling

**When to use:** Jobs asking for attribution analysis, multi-touch attribution, customer journey tracking

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

Which touchpoints actually drive conversions? I built 5 attribution models to find out.

**The Problem:**
You're spending across multiple channels (Paid Search, Paid Social, Email, Organic), but which touchpoints deserve credit for the sale?

**My Solution:**
Attribution Modeling module with 5 industry-standard models:

**1. First-Touch Attribution**
- 100% credit to first touchpoint
- Use case: Brand awareness campaigns

**2. Last-Touch Attribution**
- 100% credit to last touchpoint before conversion
- Use case: Direct response campaigns

**3. Linear Attribution**
- Equal credit to all touchpoints
- Use case: Multi-channel strategies

**4. Time-Decay Attribution**
- More credit to touchpoints closer to conversion
- Use case: Long sales cycles

**5. Position-Based Attribution (U-shaped)**
- 40% to first, 40% to last, 20% distributed to middle
- Use case: Complex customer journeys

**Visual Comparison:**
Side-by-side view of how each model allocates credit - makes channel optimization decisions obvious.

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/
(Select "Marketing Analytics" → "Attribution Modeling" tab)

### Template 8: Claude AI Integration Project

**When to use:** Jobs asking for AI integration, LLM implementation, Anthropic Claude API work

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

I've integrated Claude API into 3 production modules with retry logic and cost optimization.

**My Experience:**

**Module 1: Content Engine**
- Generates LinkedIn posts using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- 6 templates, 5 tone options, dynamic prompt construction
- Exponential backoff retry decorator for rate limits
- Cost: $0.003 per post (vs $50-150 for human writers)

**Module 2: Data Detective**
- AI-powered data insights from CSV/Excel uploads
- Natural language queries: users ask questions, AI answers based on their data
- Handles structured data context efficiently (summarizes large datasets)

**Module 3: Agent Logic (Sentiment Scout)**
- Sentiment analysis of financial news
- Combines traditional NLP with Claude for nuanced market sentiment
- Returns scores (-100 to +100) with reasoning

**Technical Patterns I've Implemented:**

**1. Graceful Degradation:**
```python
try:
    from anthropic import Anthropic
    ANTHROPIC_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    ANTHROPIC_AVAILABLE = False
```
App works without API, but shows upgrade option.

**2. Retry Logic:**
```python
@retry_with_exponential_backoff(max_attempts=3, initial_delay=1.0)
def _call_claude_api(client, prompt):
    # Handles RateLimitError, APIConnectionError, APITimeoutError
    # Never retries on auth errors
```

**3. Session-Based API Keys:**
```python
api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    api_key = st.session_state.get("anthropic_api_key")
```
No hardcoded credentials, secure handling.

**4. Cost Optimization:**
- Cache common prompts using Streamlit's `@st.cache_data`
- Limit max_tokens to prevent runaway costs
- Show estimated cost before generation

**5. Error Handling:**
Clear user messages for:
- Invalid API keys
- Rate limit exceeded
- Network timeouts
- Service outages

See live examples: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/
(Content Engine, Data Detective, or Agent Logic modules)
