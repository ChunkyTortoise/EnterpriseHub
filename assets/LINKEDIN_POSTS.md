I built what would cost $24,000 at Bloomberg - for free.

Bloomberg Terminal charges $2,000/month for market data and technical analysis.

I replicated the core features in Python:

📊 4-Panel Technical Analysis:
- Candlestick charts with moving averages
- RSI indicator (overbought/oversold signals)
- MACD histogram (momentum tracking)
- Volume analysis (green/red bars)

🔧 Built with:
- Python + Streamlit (web framework)
- yfinance (real-time data)
- ta library (technical indicators)
- Plotly (interactive charts)

💰 Cost comparison:
- Bloomberg: $24,000/year
- My solution: $0 (open source)

The screenshot shows SPY (S&P 500 ETF) over 6 months - same quality as Bloomberg, zero subscription.

Full platform (7 modules, 220+ tests) is live. Link in comments.

Most portfolio projects have 0 tests. Mine has 220+.

Because side projects aren't real unless they survive production.

EnterpriseHub: 7 business tools I built to enterprise standards.

📌 The Problem:
"Can you build production-quality software?" ← How do you prove this in an interview?

📌 My Solution:
Build a real platform. Ship it. Test it. Document it. Deploy it.

📊 Data Detective - Automated data analysis:
- Upload CSV → Get AI insights in 2 minutes (not 2 hours)
- Correlation heatmaps, outlier detection, quality scoring
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet analyzes your data and writes findings

💰 Margin Hunter - Financial modeling:
- Break-even analysis, CVP charts, sensitivity heatmaps
- 100 profit scenarios visualized simultaneously
- One-click scenario comparison (Break-Even vs Current vs Target)

🧪 Production Quality Proof:
- 220+ automated tests (pytest)
- 85% code coverage
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Type hints throughout
- Pre-commit hooks (Black, isort, Flake8, mypy)
- Live on Streamlit Cloud

What most impressed me building this:
The difference between "it works on my machine" and "it works in production" is about 200 tests.

Full platform link in comments. All 7 modules live.

I spent 930+ hours on certifications. Then built this to prove I learned something.

Certifications are great for fundamentals. But hiring managers want proof.

So I built EnterpriseHub - 7 production tools that prove the skills:

📈 Marketing Analytics (Google Digital Marketing + Meta Social Media certs)
- Campaign ROI tracking
- A/B test significance calculator (97.7% confidence)
- 5 attribution models (First-Touch to Position-Based)
- Customer metrics (CAC, CLV, CLV:CAC ratio)

🤖 Content Engine (Vanderbilt GenAI + DeepLearning.AI certs)
- AI-powered LinkedIn post generator
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration
- 6 templates, 5 tones
- Cost: $0.003 per post (vs $50-150 human writers)

🔍 Data Detective (Microsoft GenAI for Data + Google Data Analytics certs)
- Automated exploratory data analysis
- AI insights from your CSV/Excel files
- Correlation heatmaps, quality scoring
- Natural language queries: "What's average revenue by region?"

💰 Margin Hunter (IBM BI Analyst cert)
- Break-even analysis
- CVP modeling with sensitivity heatmaps
- 100 pricing scenarios visualized
- Perfect for SaaS, e-commerce, consulting pricing

Plus 3 more modules: Market Pulse (technical analysis), Financial Analyst (fundamental analysis), Agent Logic (sentiment analysis).

🧪 Built to Production Standards:
- 7 modules
- 220+ automated tests
- 85% code coverage
- CI/CD pipeline
- Live deployment (Streamlit Cloud)
- Full documentation

My certifications (10 completed, ~930 hours):
✓ Vanderbilt Generative AI Strategic Leader
✓ DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization
✓ Google Data Analytics
✓ Google Digital Marketing & E-commerce
✓ IBM Business Intelligence Analyst
✓ Microsoft Generative AI for Data Analysis
✓ Meta Social Media Marketing
✓ Google Cloud Generative AI Leader
✓ ChatGPT Personal Automation (Vanderbilt)
✓ AI For Everyone (DeepLearning.AI)

(Plus 9 in-progress, ~838 hours more)

The Lesson:
Certifications teach you syntax.
Projects teach you software engineering.
Both together? That's how you stand out.

## Bonus Posts (Use During Week 2-3)

### Post #4: Behind-the-Scenes (Architecture Deep-Dive)

**Best Time:** Wednesday, 9-11 AM EST
**Attach:** Screenshot of GitHub repo or architecture diagram
**Goal:** Appeal to senior engineers and architects

```
7 modules. 0 cross-imports. Here's why.

EnterpriseHub's architecture is designed for maintainability, not cleverness.

🔧 The Pattern:
- 7 independent modules (no module imports another module)
- Shared utilities layer (data_loader, logger, exceptions)
- Single entry point: app.py with dynamic module loading
- Each module: ONE render() function, NO arguments

Why this matters:

❌ BAD (Tightly Coupled):
```python
from modules.marketing_analytics import calculate_roi
# Now margin_hunter depends on marketing_analytics
# Change marketing? Margin Hunter breaks. Nightmare.
```

✅ GOOD (Utilities Layer):
```python
from utils.data_loader import get_stock_data
# All modules use shared utils
# Change utils? Tests catch breaks. Easy fix.
```

📦 The Result:
- Any module can be deleted without breaking others
- New modules add in ~30 minutes
- Tests are isolated (no cascading failures)
- Future-proof for microservices (each module → service)

💡 The Tradeoff:
Some code duplication vs. zero coupling. I chose maintainability.

What's your take on code duplication vs. abstraction?

### Post #5: AI Integration Deep-Dive

**Best Time:** Thursday, 8-10 AM EST
**Attach:** Code snippet screenshot or `content-engine-output.png`
**Goal:** Attract AI/LLM integration jobs

```
I've integrated Claude API into 3 production modules. Here's what I learned.

Most demos show the happy path: "API works, look at the output!"

But production is about the unhappy paths:
- Rate limits
- Network timeouts
- Invalid API keys
- Service outages
- Cost overruns

🛠️ My Solutions:

1. Graceful Degradation
```python
try:
    from anthropic import Anthropic
    ANTHROPIC_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    ANTHROPIC_AVAILABLE = False
```
App works without AI. Users see "upgrade to unlock AI" instead of errors.

2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
```python
@retry_with_exponential_backoff(max_attempts=3)
def _call_claude_api(client, prompt):
    return client.messages.create(...)
```
Handles transient failures. Never retries on auth errors.

3. Cost Monitoring
- Cache common prompts (Streamlit's @st.cache_data)
- Limit max_tokens (prevent runaway costs)
- Show estimated cost before generation

4. Session-Based API Keys
```python
api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    api_key = st.session_state.get("anthropic_api_key")
```
No hardcoded credentials. Secure by default.

5. Error Messaging
Clear user feedback:
- "Invalid API key" (not "401 Unauthorized")
- "Rate limit exceeded. Retry in 30s" (not "429 Too Many Requests")
- "Service unavailable. Try again later" (not "503 Server Error")

📊 3 Modules Using Claude:
- Content Engine (LinkedIn post generation)
- Data Detective (AI insights from CSV)
- Agent Logic (sentiment analysis)

All live, all production-ready, all handling errors gracefully.

**When someone asks "How long did this take?"**
```
Great question! About 3 months of focused work:
- Week 1-4: Margin Hunter (hero project)
- Week 5-8: Marketing Analytics + Data Detective
- Week 9-12: Remaining modules + tests + deployment

But honestly, the 220+ tests took almost as long as the features themselves. That's where real engineering happens.
```

**When someone asks "Are you looking for work?"**
```
Yes! I'm looking for [contract/full-time] roles building:
- AI-powered business tools
- Data dashboards and analytics platforms
- Streamlit applications
- Claude/LLM integrations

Feel free to DM me or email: [your email]
```

**When someone asks "Can I see the code?"**

**Context:** After posting, reach out to 5 CTOs/VPs at Series A-C startups

```
Subject: Quick feedback on my portfolio?

Hi [First Name],

I saw you're building [product/team] at [Company] - really cool mission.

I just shipped a 7-module business platform with Python + Claude API (220+ tests, live deployment). Would love your perspective if you have 2 minutes: [demo link]

What do you look for in portfolio projects when evaluating candidates?

No pitch - genuinely curious about your take.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

P.S. I'm looking for [contract/full-time] Python/AI roles if your team is hiring.
```

**Why This Works:**
- No hard sell (just asking for feedback)
- Shows you researched them (mention their company)
- Respects their time ("2 minutes")
- Soft CTA in P.S. (not aggressive)

**Response Rate:** ~20-30% (much higher than cold applications)
