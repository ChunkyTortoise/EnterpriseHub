## 🏛️ THE ARCHITECTURE: "Institutional Rigor"
I build AI systems for executives who demand technical bulletproofing. My platforms are not "GPT wrappers"; they are stateful, self-correcting swarms designed to handle complex business logic without human intervention.

### 🛡️ The 522+ Test Suite
Every financial formula, ROI calculation, and agentic decision loop in my portfolio is validated by a rigorous **Pytest-driven CI/CD pipeline**. 
- **85%+ Code Coverage**
- **Zero-Tolerance for Hallucination**: Integrated self-correction nodes via LangGraph.
- **Data Integrity**: NumPy-powered vectorization for sub-50ms mathematical accuracy.

## 🎭 THE AESTHETIC: "Cinematic UI v4.0"
I believe that high-ticket software should look as good as it performs. My **Cinematic UI v4.0** design system brings "Editorial FinTech" aesthetics to the Streamlit ecosystem.

- **Glassmorphic Interfaces**: 10px backdrop-blur depth.
- **Animated Mesh Gradients**: Luxury 20s ease-infinite visual foundations.
- **Institutional Palette**: High-contrast "Slate & Emerald" color theory (WCAG AAA Compliant).
- **Tactile Feedback**: 3D hover-lift interactions and animated metrics.
