# Advanced Compensation Strategy: Lyrio.io

If Jorge loves your "Sniper" project but can't afford the $5k+ price tag for a larger build, use these "Bridge Options" to get paid what you're worth.

## 1. The "Software-as-a-Service" (SaaS) License
**Pitch:** "Jorge, instead of you paying $5,000 for me to build this and own it, I’ll build it on my own infrastructure and license it to Lyrio for $500/mo. I'll handle the maintenance and updates."
*   **Why it works:** It shifts his expense from CapEx (big one-time cost) to OpEx (smaller monthly cost). 
*   **Your Upside:** You own the code. If you work with other GHL agencies later, you can sell them the same tool.

## 2. The "Efficiency Kicker" (Cost Savings Share)
**Pitch:** "I noticed your AI is burning through OpenAI tokens. If I can refactor your code to reduce your API costs by 30%, I’d like to keep 50% of those savings for the first 12 months."
*   **Why it works:** It costs him $0 out of pocket. You are literally being paid out of the money you *saved* him.

## 3. Advisory Equity (The FAST Model)
**Pitch:** "I can see myself being a long-term partner here. Let's do a FAST Agreement for 0.5% equity. This covers my 'CTO-level' strategic advice, and we can keep the project builds as separate fixed-price engagements."
*   **Why it works:** It gives you a "seat at the table" and makes you an owner, not a vendor.

## 4. Revenue Share on "Premium" Features
**Pitch:** "Let's make this new AI Matcher a 'Premium' add-on for your Lyrio users. You charge them an extra $50/mo for it, and I take $15 of that."
*   **Why it works:** This is the ultimate "win-win." You only get paid when his customers are happy and paying more.

## 5. Phantom Equity (Stock Appreciation Rights)
**Pitch:** "If actual equity is too complex right now, let's do a Phantom Stock agreement. If Lyrio sells or hits a $10M valuation, I get a bonus equal to 1% of the company value."
*   **Why it works:** Simple contract, no cap table mess, huge potential upside.
