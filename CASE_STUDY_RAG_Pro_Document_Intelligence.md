| Inconsistent analysis | Different reviewers, different findings |
| No source verification | Claims couldn't be easily verified |

## Use Case Examples

### Example 1: Commercial Lease Review
A property manager needed to review a 45-page commercial lease. Instead of 3 days, RAG Pro analyzed it in 4 minutes, identifying:

- ✅ 3 missing tenant responsibilities clauses
- ✅ Escalation clause discrepancy (found $8K/year potential overcharge)
- ✅ Renewal notification deadline (saved from missing 90-day window)

**Result**: Negotiated $24,000 in savings before signing.

### Example 2: Due Diligence for Acquisition
Before acquiring a 12-unit apartment complex, the firm needed to review 200+ documents (rent rolls, insurance, permits, vendor contracts).

- **Time**: 3 weeks → 4 hours
- **Issues Found**: 7 expired permits, 2 insurance gaps, 1 pending lawsuit

**Result**: Used findings to negotiate $35,000 price reduction.

### Example 3: Compliance Audit
Quarterly compliance review of 180 lease agreements previously required 2 full-time staff for 3 weeks.

- **Time**: 6 weeks → 2 hours
- **Missing Documents**: 23 identified
- **Compliance Issues**: 8 critical (HVAC certifications, safety inspections)

**Result**: Avoided $50,000 in potential fines.
