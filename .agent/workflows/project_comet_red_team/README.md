### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Comet browser, despite its likely Chromium foundation, presents a rich attack surface due to potential custom modifications, the inherent complexity of modern browser engines, and the ever-expanding landscape of web APIs. Our primary focus areas for exploitation revolve around breaking the renderer sandbox via IPC vulnerabilities, achieving arbitrary code execution within the rendering and JavaScript engines (Blink/V8), abusing the extension model for privilege escalation, and exploiting weaknesses in network protocol handling. Key vulnerabilities are anticipated to arise from deserialization flaws, type confusion, race conditions, and logic bugs in newly implemented or customized features. A successful attack chain would likely involve a drive-by download or malicious advertisement scenario, leading to sandbox escape and persistence on the target system. The goal is to articulate not just *if* vulnerabilities exist, but *how* they could be leveraged for maximum impact.
