## insight-engine — Data-Driven Decisions for Real Estate Growth

---

## Executive Summary

A real estate team spending $25,000/month on marketing wanted to understand which campaigns actually generated leads—and which were wasting money. They were flying blind, unable to prove ROI to stakeholders or optimize their spend.

After implementing insight-engine's BI Analytics platform, they achieved:

- **133% increase in lead conversions**
- **47% reduction in marketing waste**
- **3.2x return on ad spend**

**Investment: $5,000 - $10,000** (depending on complexity)

## The Challenge

| Before | Pain Point |
|--------|------------|
| Scattered data | Marketing in Meta, leads in GHL, closes in CRM |
| No attribution | "We don't know which ad brought this lead" |
| Reactive decisions | Optimizing based on last month, not real-time |
| Stakeholder blind spots | Couldn't prove marketing ROI |
| Wasted budget | 60%+ of spend going to ineffective channels |

The team was spending **$300,000 annually** on marketing with no way to measure true ROI.

## Use Case Examples

### Example 1: Facebook Ads Optimization
The team thought Facebook was their best performer. Attribution revealed:

- **Reality**: Facebook drove awareness, but Google drove closes
- **Insight**: 3-touch "assisted" model showed Facebook was actually 40% of the journey
- **Action**: Rebalanced spend; added retargeting
- **Result**: Cost per closing dropped from $890 to $312

### Example 2: Predictive Lead Scoring
Using predictive analytics, the system identified that leads with these traits converted at 4x average:

- ✓ Visited property 3+ times
- ✓ Requested info on schools in the area
- ✓ Viewed mortgage calculator
- ✓ Returned within 7 days

**Result**: Agents prioritized these leads first, increasing close rate from 12% to 31%.

### Example 3: Churn Detection & Retention
The team was losing 23% of past clients to other agents annually.

- **Detection**: System identified clients showing "risk signals" (no engagement in 60 days, visited competitor sites)
- **Intervention**: Automated nurture sequences + agent check-ins
- **Result**: Reduced churn to 9%, saving $180K in lost future business
