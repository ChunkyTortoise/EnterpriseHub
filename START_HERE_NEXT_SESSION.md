## 🎯 Phase 4 Preview

**Goal:** Make README and portfolio lead with ARETE  
**Time:** ~2 hours (but we're fast, probably less)

**Tasks:**
1. Rewrite README - Lead with ARETE features
2. Update case study - Add "Builds Itself Out of a Job" section
3. Extract proposal - Create `docs/sales/TAILORED_ARETE_PROPOSAL.md`
4. Create LinkedIn posts - 3 ready-to-deploy posts
5. Generate visual assets - Architecture diagram
6. Validate links - Ensure all docs work

**Why This Matters:**
Portfolio materials are the first impression. Right now they're good. After Phase 4, they'll be excellent and ARETE-focused.
