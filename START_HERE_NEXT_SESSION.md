- User has screenshots showing errors and incomplete modules
- Goal: Fix all bugs before visual enhancement

Workflow:
1. Receive error screenshots from user
2. Triage by severity (P0/P1/P2/P3)
3. Fix critical issues first (P0 → P1 → P2)
4. Test and validate each fix
5. Ensure all modules are demo-ready
6. Then proceed to visual enhancement

Target: Zero P0 issues, minimal P1 issues, all modules functional

## 🐛 Bug Fixing Preview (DO THIS FIRST)

**Goal:** Fix errors and complete modules before visual polish  
**Time:** ~1-3 hours (depends on issue severity)

**Critical Insight:**
User has screenshots showing errors and incomplete modules. We must fix these BEFORE visual enhancement. No point polishing broken code.

**Workflow:**
1. **Triage:** Receive error screenshots, categorize by severity (P0/P1/P2/P3)
2. **Fix:** Resolve critical issues first (P0 = blocks demo, P1 = major bugs)
3. **Test:** Validate each fix, ensure no regressions
4. **Validate:** All modules must be demo-ready and error-free
5. **Then:** Proceed to visual enhancement (only after bugs fixed)

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't demo broken modules in portfolio
- One critical error destroys credibility
- Stability before aesthetics
- Current risk: Win probability could drop to 50-60% if bugs shown

**After Fixes:**
- Resume 75-80% baseline win probability
- Ready for visual enhancement
- Screenshot quality becomes the focus
