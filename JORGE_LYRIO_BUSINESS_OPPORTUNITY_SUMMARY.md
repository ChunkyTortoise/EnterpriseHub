Subject: AI Enhancement Partnership - 5x Revenue Growth Opportunity

Hi Jorge,

I hope this finds you well. I've been analyzing opportunities in the real estate CRM space and came across lyrio.io. I'm impressed with what you've built.

I recently completed a comprehensive AI platform for real estate professionals that generated over $362,000 in annual automation value. I believe there's a significant opportunity to enhance lyrio.io with similar AI capabilities that could potentially 3-5x your current revenue.

I've prepared:
• Technical analysis of enhancement opportunities
• Revenue growth projections showing $200K-1.5M potential
• Multiple partnership models (including revenue sharing)
• Proof-of-concept platform you can see in action

Would you be open to a brief call to explore how we might work together? I think you'd find the revenue projections particularly interesting.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Contact Info]

P.S. I have working demos of real estate AI scenarios showing $136K+ in commission capture that I think would resonate with your target market.
