| **Type** | Fixed |
| **Budget** | $500 |
| **Posted** | January 5, 2026 |
| **Fit Score** | **8/10** |

**Scoring Breakdown**:
- Skill match (4/4): MCP, AI orchestration, backend engineering, conversation context = strong match
- Budget (2/2): $500 fixed, within project range

| **Budget** | $65 |
| **Posted** | February 15, 2026 |
| **Fit Score** | **6/10** |

**Scoring Breakdown**:
- Skill match (4/4): Claude Code expertise = exact match
- Budget (0/2): $65 is far below minimum
- Few proposals (1/2): Niche Claude Code + OpenClaw, few qualified
- Urgency (1/1): Recent posting
- Scope clarity (0/1): Unclear scope from title alone

| **Type** | Fixed |
| **Budget** | $150 (Contract to Hire) |
| **Posted** | September 2025 |
| **Fit Score** | **7/10** |

**Scoring Breakdown**:
- Skill match (4/4): RAG + LLM + FastAPI + Docker = exact stack match
- Budget (0/2): $150 initial but contract-to-hire signals larger engagement
- Few proposals (1/2): Older posting may have fewer active applicants
- Urgency (1/1): Contract-to-hire signals ongoing need
- Scope clarity (1/1): Clear tech stack requirements

**Rationale**: Contract-to-hire is interesting -- $150 entry point but could convert to $65-75/hr long-term. Our RAG system with hybrid search, FastAPI backend, and Docker deployment is a direct match.

**Proposal angle**: Position the $150 as a discovery phase. Demonstrate value quickly with existing RAG codebase.

| **Type** | Hourly |
| **Budget** | Full-time week, immediate start |
| **Posted** | Recent |
| **Fit Score** | **7/10** |

**Scoring Breakdown**:
- Skill match (3/4): RAG + Python + LangChain match, scraping is secondary skill
- Budget (2/2): Full-time week at hourly rate = $2,600+ at our rates
- Few proposals (1/2): "Immediate start" filters to available talent
- Urgency (1/1): "Immediate start" = high urgency
- Scope clarity (0/1): Scraper + RAG is broad, unclear specific deliverables

**Rationale**: Immediate start signals urgency and willingness to pay for availability. RAG + data engineering aligns with our pipeline expertise. Scraping via Playwright/BeautifulSoup is a secondary skill we have.

**Proposal angle**: Emphasize immediate availability and existing RAG infrastructure. Offer to start same-day with working pipeline.

| **Type** | Service listing (competitor reference) |
| **Budget** | N/A (market intelligence) |
| **Posted** | Active |
| **Fit Score** | **N/A -- Market Intelligence** |
