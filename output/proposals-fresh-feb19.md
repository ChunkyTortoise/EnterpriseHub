- Technical match is strong but ROI on connects is poor
- Could propose at $300-500 if client is flexible on budget

### Proposal 1: AI Developer for Enhancing RAG Pipeline and Building Intelligent Agent

**Job**: AI Developer for Enhancing RAG Pipeline and Building Intelligent Agent
**URL**: https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/Developer-for-Enhancing-RAG-Pipeline-and-Building-Intelligent-Agent_~021996259481050294291/
**Match Score**: 9/10
**Recommended Bid**: $75/hr or $2,500-$4,000 fixed

#### Full Proposal (237 words)

Enhancing a RAG pipeline and building an intelligent agent on top of it is exactly what I've been doing for the past year -- in production, with measurable results.

I'm a senior AI engineer with 20+ years of software experience and 11 production repositories. My most relevant projects:

**DocQA Engine** (https://chunkytortoise.github.io) -- Production RAG system with BM25 + semantic hybrid retrieval, cross-encoder reranking, and multi-hop question answering. Citation faithfulness score of 0.88. 500+ automated tests, FastAPI backend, Docker deployment. This is the exact pipeline architecture your enhancement work will build on.

**AgentForge** -- Multi-agent orchestration framework with ReAct agent loops, tool dispatch (4.3M/sec benchmark), evaluation framework, and model registry. 550+ tests. This is the agent-building layer you need on top of the RAG pipeline.

**EnterpriseHub** -- Enterprise RAG system (advanced_rag_system/src/) with 3-tier Redis caching that achieved 89% LLM cost reduction and 88% cache hit rate. 5,100+ tests. Shows the optimization path from working pipeline to production-grade system.

For your project, my approach:
- **Phase 1**: Audit current pipeline -- retrieval quality metrics, latency profiling, chunk quality analysis
- **Phase 2**: Targeted enhancements -- reranking, hybrid retrieval tuning, embedding optimization
- **Phase 3**: Intelligent agent layer -- tool integration, conversation memory, evaluation framework

All code ships with comprehensive tests (I maintain 8,500+ across my repos), CI/CD, and documentation.

Happy to walk through my DocQA codebase -- it maps directly to your requirements.

### Proposal 2: Teach Me How to Use Claude Code

**Job**: Teach Me How to Use Claude Code
**URL**: https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/Teach-how-use-Claude-code_~022022096767177839983/
**Match Score**: 8/10
**Recommended Bid**: $65/hr

#### Full Proposal (228 words)

You want to build landing pages and LinkedIn AI agents with Claude Code -- I use Claude Code daily across 11 production repositories and have configured 22 specialized Claude Code agents for different engineering tasks. I can get you productive fast.

My Claude Code expertise:

**Daily Production Use** -- I write code, run tests, debug, and deploy with Claude Code every day. My repos have 8,500+ automated tests largely written with Claude Code assistance. I know every workflow shortcut, MCP integration pattern, and prompting technique that makes Claude Code productive.

**AI Agent Building** -- I built AgentForge, a multi-agent framework (4.3M tool dispatches/sec, 550+ tests), and 3 production AI chatbots for a real estate CRM. Building the LinkedIn content agents you described is directly in my wheelhouse.

**MCP Server Toolkit** -- I published mcp-server-toolkit on PyPI, so I understand the Claude ecosystem at the infrastructure level, not just the UI.

What I'd deliver in our Zoom sessions:
- **Session 1**: Claude Code setup, project configuration, building your first landing page live
- **Session 2**: Advanced workflows -- multi-file edits, test-driven development, deployment
- **Session 3**: Building your LinkedIn AI agents -- prompt design, automation, content pipeline
- **Ongoing**: Async support as you build independently

I'm based in California (PST), have strong English, and do video calls regularly with clients.

Want to schedule a 15-minute intro call this week?

### Proposal 3: GoHighLevel Expert Needed to Set Up CRM, Funnels & AI Automations

**Job**: GoHighLevel Expert Needed to Set Up CRM, Funnels & AI Automations for My Business
**URL**: https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/GoHighLevel-Expert-Needed-Set-CRM-Funnels-Automations-for-Business_~022019515181492591683/
**Match Score**: 9/10
**Recommended Bid**: $65-70/hr

#### Full Proposal (244 words)

Setting up GoHighLevel from the ground up with AI automations baked in is exactly what I built for a real estate operation in Rancho Cucamonga -- and it's running in production right now.

**EnterpriseHub** (https://chunkytortoise.github.io) is my production GHL platform:
- **Complete CRM setup**: Pipelines, workflows, contact management, tag-based routing, and reporting dashboards -- all configured and battle-tested
- **3 AI chatbots**: Lead qualification bot, buyer advisor, and seller evaluator -- each with autonomous conversation flow, intent detection, and GHL field updates in real-time
- **GHL API integration**: Custom rate-limited client (10 req/s), webhook handlers, temperature tag publishing (Hot/Warm/Cold), calendar booking, custom field validation
- **Funnel-to-CRM automation**: Leads flow from intake forms through AI qualification to pipeline stages automatically
- **5,100+ automated tests** ensuring every workflow fires correctly

What sets my GHL work apart from typical implementers:
- **AI-native**: I don't just configure GHL -- I build AI automations that qualify leads, score contacts, and trigger workflows based on conversation intelligence
- **Integration depth**: I've built adapters for GHL + HubSpot + Salesforce under a unified protocol, so I understand multi-CRM architecture
- **Production-grade**: Docker deployment, monitoring (P50/P95/P99 latency), structured logging, rate limiting

For your setup, I'd start with a scoping call to understand your business, then deliver:
- CRM pipeline structure + contact management
- Funnel/website setup with form integrations
- AI-powered automation workflows
- Calendar, email, SMS, and payment integrations

Available 30+ hrs/week immediately. Quick call to scope your setup?

## Notes

- Jobs #1, #3, and #5 were found via Upwork search snippets; exact posting dates could not be confirmed due to 403 blocks. They appear in current Feb 2026 search results and were NOT in the Feb 18 batch.
- Job #2 (Claude Code) is a unique opportunity -- very few freelancers have daily Claude Code production experience with 22 configured agents.
- Job #4 budget ($100) is too low for scope but included for completeness.
- All proposals follow the established style: lead with the client's problem, proof via specific projects + metrics, concrete deliverables, call-to-action.
