#### Quick Win Opening (30 seconds)

> "I've built a production multi-agent system that handles exactly this - task routing, calendar integration, and intelligent handoffs between specialized agents. For your AI secretary, I'd use a task classification layer that routes incoming requests to domain-specific sub-agents: calendar, email drafting, research, reminders. Let me walk you through the architecture."

#### Their Pain Points & Your Solutions

| Pain Point | Your Solution |
|------------|---------------|
| Gmail/Outlook OAuth | Encrypted token storage, auto-refresh, webhook monitoring |
| Calendar availability | FreeBusy API, preference-aware slot selection |
| Email drafting | Template-based + LLM customization, approval workflow |
| User preference learning | Edit analysis, preference updates, personalization |
| Data privacy | Fernet encryption, GDPR compliance, zero-knowledge option |

#### Architecture to Present

```

├──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬───────────┤
│ Calendar │  Email   │ Research │ Reminder  │
│  Agent   │  Agent   │  Agent   │  Agent    │
└──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴───────────┘

| Core Secretary | 4 weeks | Gmail OAuth, email fetching, task classification, calendar API, email drafting |
| Multi-Tenant SaaS | 3 weeks | User registration, auth, Stripe billing, admin dashboard |
| Polish & Launch | 2 weeks | Security audit, performance optimization, beta testing |

#### Monetization Strategy (If Asked)

| Tier | Price | Features |

#### Questions to Ask Chase

1. "What's your target market - individuals or businesses?"
2. "Do you have UI/UX designs already?"
3. "What's your expected launch date?"
4. "Are you open to using existing services (Stripe, Twilio)?"
5. "What's your biggest concern - speed, cost, or features?"

#### Closing Script

> "Thanks for walking me through the project, Chase. This aligns perfectly with my experience - I've already built the core architecture you need in EnterpriseHub. I'm excited about the AI secretary concept. I'll send you a follow-up with an architecture diagram tomorrow. What's the best next step - would you like a detailed proposal, or should we do a deeper technical dive first?"

## 💬 Common Q&A

### "What's your biggest failure?"

> "Jorge handoff service had circular handoff bug in production - Lead bot → Buyer bot → Lead bot infinite loop. Fixed with time-based cooldown (30min) + rate limiting (3/hr, 10/day). Handoff success rate improved 60% → 92%. Lesson: Multi-agent systems need explicit anti-loop guards."

### "How do you prevent hallucinations?"

> "Multi-layer defense: (1) Cache verified responses (88% hit rate = no LLM call), (2) RAG score thresholds (<0.7 = 'I don't know'), (3) Structured output with validation, (4) Explicit prompt instructions, (5) Eval suite for hallucination triggers."

### "How do you scale to 10,000 tenants?"

> "Phase 1 (0-100): Monolithic, vertical scaling. Phase 2 (100-1K): Read replicas, Redis cluster, horizontal API. Phase 3 (1K-10K): Database sharding, message queues, CDN, separate infra for whale tenants."

### "What are your rates?"

> "Hourly: $65-75/hr. Custom project: $1,500-$4,000. Enterprise phase: $8,000-$12,000. For Chase MVP: ~$11,000 fixed (9 weeks × 20 hrs/week × $65/hr)."
