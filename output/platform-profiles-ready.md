# 1. CONTRA (Priority: HIGH — 0% Commission)

## Profile Headline (98 chars)

```
AI Engineer — RAG Systems, Multi-Agent Chatbots & Data Dashboards | Python, FastAPI, LangChain
```

## Bio / About (380 words)

```
I build production AI systems that businesses deploy and scale — not prototypes that sit in a repo.

My work sits at the intersection of large language models and real software engineering. I design RAG document search engines that answer questions from thousands of pages with cited sources, multi-agent chatbot systems that qualify leads and hand off to humans at exactly the right moment, and interactive data dashboards that turn raw CSV exports into executive-ready analytics.

What makes my work different is the engineering underneath. Every system ships with automated tests (8,500+ across my portfolio), CI/CD pipelines, Docker deployment, structured logging, and documentation. You get a solution that runs in production on day one — not something that breaks the first time real data hits it.

The numbers behind my systems:
- 89% reduction in LLM API costs through intelligent caching and prompt optimization
- 88% cache hit rate across L1/L2/L3 tiers, cutting response latency below 200ms
- 94% retrieval precision in RAG pipelines with hybrid search (dense + sparse)
- 4.3M message dispatches per second in event-driven architectures

My core stack is Python, FastAPI, LangChain, PostgreSQL, Redis, Streamlit, and Docker. I integrate with Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce, and Stripe. I deploy to AWS, Railway, Vercel, and bare metal.

I have 11 open-source production repositories on GitHub — every one with tests, CI, and live demos you can try before we talk. This is not a portfolio of tutorial projects. These are systems handling real traffic with real users.

I work from Palm Springs, CA (Pacific time) and can start within 24-48 hours of project kickoff. I communicate clearly, deliver on schedule, and document everything so your team can maintain the system without me.

If you need an AI system that actually works in production — RAG search, chatbot orchestration, data pipelines, or automation — I would like to hear about your project.

```

## Platform-Specific Tips for Freelancer.com

1. **Bid aggressively on Day 1**: Send 10-15 proposals within the first 24 hours. Freelancer.com's algorithm favors active bidders. You get limited free bids per month — use them strategically on AI/Python projects.
2. **Use the AI proposal tool**: Freelancer.com offers an AI-powered proposal writer that reportedly increases hire rates by 15%. Use it as a starting draft, then customize.
3. **Price fixed-price projects competitively**: For your first 5 projects, price 15-20% below market to win bids. The reviews are worth more than the margin.
4. **Win a contest**: Freelancer.com has coding contests. Enter Python/AI contests to showcase skills and get profile visibility without bidding.
5. **Complete the "Preferred Freelancer" requirements**: Verify identity, take the Freelancer.com exam for Python/AI, and maintain a high response rate. This badge significantly increases visibility.
6. **Accept the 15-day hold**: Your first withdrawal will be delayed 15 days. Plan accordingly — this platform is a pipeline builder, not a quick-pay solution.
7. **Specialize your bid message**: Never send generic proposals. Reference the client's specific project, explain your relevant experience, and link to a specific portfolio piece that matches their need.
8. **Set up milestone payments**: For larger projects ($500+), break the work into milestones. This protects both parties and builds client confidence.

Banner: Guru.com has a simple header area. Upload a clean banner showing a split layout: code on the left (Python/FastAPI), dashboard screenshot on the right. Include "AI Systems Engineering" as text overlay. Use dark tones — the platform's design is light/white, so a darker banner creates visual contrast.
```

## Platform-Specific Tips for Guru.com

1. **Emphasize SafePay in proposals**: "I always use Guru's SafePay escrow so your funds are protected. You only release payment when you are satisfied with the delivery." This builds trust with cautious first-time clients.
2. **Start with the free tier**: The 9% fee is higher than Freelancer.com, but there is no first-withdrawal hold. Once you land your first $500+ project, upgrade to Professional ($15.95/mo) to drop the fee to 7.5%.
3. **Bid on "Invite Only" jobs**: Guru.com allows employers to invite freelancers. A complete, keyword-rich profile increases invite frequency. Fill out every field.
4. **Use the Workroom effectively**: Guru's Workroom is where projects are managed. Deliver files, track milestones, and communicate within the Workroom so everything is documented for dispute protection.
5. **Highlight payment protection in bios**: Guru clients choose the platform specifically for SafePay. Acknowledging this in your profile signals that you understand the platform.
6. **Set realistic milestones**: Break larger projects into 3-5 milestones with clear deliverables. This increases client confidence and triggers partial payments throughout the project.
7. **Get verified**: Complete identity verification and skill tests early. Guru shows verification badges in search results.
8. **Target returning clients**: Guru has strong repeat-hire patterns. Over-deliver on the first project and offer a "returning client" rate for follow-up work.
