I build production AI systems that reduce costs, qualify leads, and turn raw data into actionable insights. My specialty is enterprise-grade Python applications: RAG document search, multi-agent chatbot orchestration, and interactive BI dashboards.

Every project ships with automated tests (8,500+ across my portfolio), Docker deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and full documentation. I do not deliver prototypes -- I deliver systems you can run in production on day one.

What sets me apart:
- 89% LLM cost reduction via 3-tier Redis caching (verified benchmarks)
- 94% retrieval precision in RAG systems (RAGAS evaluated)
- 4,937 automated tests on my chatbot platform alone
- 20+ years software engineering, remote-first with daily commits

I work best with teams that need AI integrated into their existing stack -- CRM sync, API endpoints, analytics dashboards, and human escalation workflows included.

If you need AI integrated into your stack (CRM sync, APIs, analytics), let's talk. Zero commission means I price competitively and you get premium work.

## Platform Tips (Reference)

1. Leverage 0% commission in proposals: "I use Contra because it lets me keep my full rate -- which means I price more competitively than I could on platforms taking 10-20%."
2. Portfolio is king on Contra. Add screenshots and live demo links to every project card.
3. Engage the community feed regularly. The algorithm surfaces active freelancers.
4. Request testimonials early -- even from open-source contributors or colleagues.
5. Cross-link your Contra URL (contra.com/caymanroden) to GitHub README, LinkedIn, and email signature.
