## Follow-up: A1 -- Claude Code AI Agent Architect ($1,500 Fixed)
**Timing**: Send if no reply after 5-7 days (OVERDUE -- submitted Feb 14, send NOW)

```
Hi -- wanted to follow up on my Claude Code agent architect proposal. Since submitting, I shipped a 3-bot AI system with confidence-scored handoffs and full MCP integration -- essentially the same orchestration pattern your YouTube content pipeline needs. The system runs 205 automated tests and handles 4.3M tool dispatches/sec. If you're still looking for someone who builds autonomous agent pipelines (not just prompt wrappers), I'd love to chat. Available for a quick call anytime this week.

## Follow-up: A2 -- Claude API/MCP for MSP Operations (~$65-75/hr)
**Timing**: Send if no reply after 5-7 days (OVERDUE -- submitted Feb 14, send NOW)

```
Hi -- circling back on the Claude API/MCP integration role for MSP operations. I recently completed an MCP server deployment connecting Claude to GoHighLevel CRM, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Playwright -- all running in production with real client data. The pattern of wiring Claude to business-specific tools via MCP is exactly what MSP operations need. I'm available 30+ hrs/week and can start within 48 hours. Happy to walk through the architecture on a quick call if that's helpful.

## Follow-up: A3 -- Full Stack Python + Claude Code (~$65-75/hr)
**Timing**: Send if no reply after 5-7 days (OVERDUE -- submitted Feb 14, send NOW)

```
Hi -- following up on the full stack Python + Claude Code position. Quick update: I just wrapped a production deployment with FastAPI async backends, PostgreSQL + Redis caching, and Claude orchestration -- 8,500+ tests across 11 repos, all CI green. The stack matches what you're building. I work 30+ hrs/week with daily commits and can ramp up same-week. Let me know if you'd like to do a quick technical screen -- happy to share screen and walk through the codebase.

## Follow-up: A4 -- Clawdbot/OpenClaw Configuration ($800 Fixed)
**Timing**: Send if no reply after 3-5 days (due Feb 21)

```
Hi -- following up on the OpenClaw configuration job. One thing I didn't mention in my proposal: I've built MCP server integrations in production (published mcp-server-toolkit on PyPI), which maps directly to wiring up OpenClaw's MCP-based tool connections for Claude and Gemini. If you're dealing with the openclaw.json model routing or getting Signal/Telegram webhooks to behave, I've debugged that exact pattern. Happy to hop on a quick call to scope what's blocking you -- no prep needed on your end.

## Follow-up: A5 -- Python LLM Workflow Developer C2H (~$65-75/hr)
**Timing**: Send if no reply after 5-7 days (OVERDUE -- submitted Feb 14, send NOW)

```
Hi -- wanted to circle back on the Python LLM workflow developer role. Since submitting, I just finished benchmarking a 3-tier LLM caching layer that cut API costs 89% on a production agent system -- the architecture doc is on my GitHub if you want to see the numbers. That kind of cost-conscious workflow engineering is what I'd bring to the contract-to-hire. If you're still evaluating candidates, I'm available for a 15-minute technical screen anytime this week.

## Follow-up: A6 -- Clawdbot Updates/Tuning Help ($500 Fixed)
**Timing**: Send if no reply after 3-5 days (due Feb 21)

```
Hi -- following up on the Clawdbot tuning job. Something I should have mentioned: I've worked extensively with prompt engineering and response pipeline tuning in production -- including a 5-stage post-processing pipeline that handles language detection, compliance checks, and output formatting before the user ever sees a response. That same approach applies directly to tuning Clawdbot's system prompts and model routing for better output quality. Let me know if you'd like to walk through what you're seeing -- I can usually diagnose tuning issues in a single call.

## Follow-up: A7 -- OpenClaw Tutor/Developer 3-step ($60-90/hr)
**Timing**: Send if no reply after 3-5 days (due Feb 21)

```
Hi -- checking in on the OpenClaw tutor/developer role. Beyond what I shared in the proposal, I've been working with multi-agent orchestration systems where agents hand off context to each other with confidence scoring -- that's essentially the pattern OpenClaw uses when routing between models and tools via MCP. If part of this role involves helping your team understand the architecture (not just configuring it), I've documented 33 Architecture Decision Records across my projects and enjoy making complex systems accessible. Would love to hear more about where you're at with the setup.

## Follow-up: A8 -- RAG Chatbot with Custom LLMs (Fixed, TBD)
**Timing**: Send if no reply after 5-7 days (OVERDUE -- submitted Feb 14, send NOW)

```
Hi -- following up on the RAG chatbot project. Since my proposal, I completed a production RAG deployment with hybrid BM25 + semantic retrieval and 0.88 citation faithfulness -- meaning every AI response is traceable to source documents. The system supports custom LLM routing (Claude, Gemini, open-source models) with automatic fallback chains. If you need a chatbot that actually cites its sources reliably, that's exactly what I've built. Live demo here if you want to try it: https://ct-prompt-lab.streamlit.app/ -- happy to discuss your specific requirements.
```

## Follow-up: A9 -- Hybrid Graph RAG/LLM Engineer (Fixed, TBD)
**Timing**: Send if no reply after 5-7 days (OVERDUE -- submitted Feb 8, follow-ups 1+2 both overdue, send combined check-in NOW)

```
Hi -- wanted to send a combined follow-up since I submitted a while back. Two updates since my proposal: (1) I deployed a production RAG system with hybrid retrieval (BM25 + semantic + re-ranking) achieving 0.88 citation faithfulness, and (2) I've been working with knowledge graph integrations for entity relationship extraction alongside vector search. The graph + RAG hybrid approach you're building is where retrieval is heading -- I'd bring both working code and architectural perspective. If the role is still open, I'm available for a technical conversation anytime. Portfolio: https://chunkytortoise.github.io
