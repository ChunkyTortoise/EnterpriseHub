## Brief 1 -- Jordan Jewkes Meeting Prep (Monday Feb 23, 2pm)

### What We Know

Jordan Jewkes connected via LinkedIn outreach. He responded positively and agreed to a meeting, now confirmed for Monday Feb 23 at 2pm. Based on the LinkedIn outreach context and the OpenClaw consulting vertical, Jordan is likely a professional services practitioner (legal, real estate, or consulting) who saw value in the AI configuration pitch.

Key signals:
- He initiated the booking, which means genuine interest (not just polite curiosity)
- He engaged through LinkedIn, so he's seen the professional profile and content
- Meeting is on a Monday afternoon -- likely carved time out of his work schedule for this

### Opening Line / Icebreaker

"Jordan, thanks for making time on a Monday afternoon. Before I get into anything, I'd love to hear what caught your attention -- what problem are you trying to solve right now?"

Let him talk first. His answer determines the entire conversation direction.

### Pivot to Services (lead with the best fit)

Based on likely profile:

**If legal/professional services** -> Lead with OpenClaw configuration:
- "Anyone can install it. I configure it so it behaves like a paralegal, not a liability."
- Price anchor: $1,500 starter configuration, ROI in 2 weeks
- Key metric: $21K/mo in recovered billable hours for law firms

**If tech/SaaS** -> Lead with Fractional AI CTO:
- Production-grade AI systems: 11 repos, 8,500+ tests, 89% LLM cost reduction
- Price anchor: $2,500 Architecture Audit as entry point
- Key metric: $3,600/mo to $400/mo on LLM costs

**If agency/marketing** -> Lead with AI automation + GHL:
- Multi-bot orchestration, lead scoring, CRM integration
- Price anchor: $500-$800 fixed project for initial setup
- Key metric: 88% cache hit rate, sub-200ms orchestration

### Questions to Ask

1. "What does your current workflow look like for [his problem area]?" (understand the pain)
2. "How much time does your team spend on [the repetitive task he mentions]?" (quantify the cost)
3. "Have you tried any AI tools before? What worked, what didn't?" (understand expectations)
4. "What would success look like in 30 days?" (set scope and timeline)
5. "Who else would need to sign off on this?" (identify decision makers)

### Desired Outcome / Next Step

Primary goal: Get a paid engagement started. Propose ONE of these:
- **$1,500 starter configuration** (if OpenClaw/professional services fit)
- **$2,500 Architecture Audit** (if tech/SaaS fit)
- **$500 fixed project** (if small scope or budget-conscious)

Close with: "Based on what you've described, here's what I'd suggest as a first step -- [specific deliverable]. It's [price], takes [timeline], and you'll have [concrete output]. If you're comfortable, I can send an invoice tonight and start this week."

If he needs time: "Totally understand. I'll send a one-page summary of what we discussed with a scope and price. Take a look and let me know by Wednesday."

## Brief 2 -- Andrew McKinnon Follow-up

Andrew McKinnon is a PI lawyer at McKinnon Law PLLC. He responded to LinkedIn outreach with a privacy question and said "I'd be interested." A detailed privacy reply was sent Feb 19. He has not yet booked a call.

### Follow-up Email (send Feb 21 if no response by then)

Subject: Re: Quick question

Hi Andrew,

Just circling back on the privacy details I sent over. Happy to answer any other questions -- I know data handling matters more in a law practice than almost anywhere else.

If you'd like to see how the system works in practice, I'm happy to do a 15-minute screen share. No prep needed on your end -- I'll walk through a demo using sample data (nothing from your practice).

Here's my calendar if a time works: [Calendly link]

If timing isn't right, no worries at all. The offer stands whenever you're ready.

Best,
Cayman

### Notes

- Tone is deliberately low-pressure. Andrew is a lawyer -- he will not respond to high-pressure sales.
- Do NOT re-pitch services. He already said "I'd be interested." The goal is simply to get on a call.
- If he replies with more privacy questions, answer them directly and re-offer the call.
- If no response by Feb 25, one final short follow-up: "Hey Andrew -- just wanted to make sure my last message didn't get buried. Happy to chat whenever timing works. No rush."
