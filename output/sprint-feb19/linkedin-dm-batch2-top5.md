## LinkedIn DM: Rick Nucci / Guru
**Target profile**: Rick Nucci, CEO at Guru. Search "Rick Nucci Guru" on LinkedIn. Former Boomi founder.

**DM text** (143 words):

Hey Rick -- congrats on Guru hitting 10 years and crossing $63M. Building an AI Source of Truth that enterprises actually trust is rare.

Quick thought: knowledge management queries are among the most cacheable AI workloads. "How does our expense policy work?" gets asked hundreds of times with slight variations across your customer base.

I built a caching system that catches these semantic duplicates -- 88% hit rate, 89% LLM cost reduction. At Guru's revenue, even a 30% AI cost savings is material.

With your Boomi background, you'd appreciate the rigor: the semantic layer detects "What's our PTO policy?" and "How many vacation days do I get?" are the same query.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough be useful? No pitch -- just architecture patterns.

## LinkedIn DM: Mike Murchison / Ada
**Target profile**: Mike Murchison, CEO at Ada. Search "Mike Murchison Ada" on LinkedIn. AI customer service, $1B+ valuation.

**DM text** (138 words):

Hey Mike -- Ada's Reasoning Engine solving resolution + upselling in one agent is the right bet. Most chatbots can barely handle one of those.

At unicorn scale, LLM cost efficiency becomes a board-level metric. Customer service queries are among the most cacheable AI workloads -- "Where's my order?" gets asked millions of times with minor variations.

I built a multi-agent system with results relevant to Ada's architecture:

- 88% cache hit rate via semantic caching
- 89% LLM cost reduction
- Confidence-scored handoffs between agents with zero context loss

Even a 20-30% improvement on LLM costs at Ada's scale saves millions annually.

I have a live demo if you're curious: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/

Worth a 30-minute call?

## LinkedIn DM: Joe Chen / Lofty (Chime)
**Target profile**: Joe Chen, CEO at Lofty (formerly Chime). Search "Joe Chen Lofty" or "Joe Chen Chime Technologies" on LinkedIn. Real estate AI platform.

**DM text** (129 words):

Hey Joe -- the Chime-to-Lofty rebrand makes strategic sense. The AI Workforce concept -- multi-agent, predictive, always-on -- is exactly where real estate tech is heading.

I built the infrastructure layer that makes multi-agent real estate AI actually work at scale:

- 89% LLM cost reduction via 3-tier caching
- Sub-200ms orchestration for multi-agent coordination
- Learned handoff thresholds that improve from historical outcomes

For Lofty's AI Workforce, this means faster responses, lower per-conversation costs, and smarter agent-to-agent handoffs as your platform scales.

I have a live demo of the orchestration engine if you'd like to see it in action.

Open to a 15-minute call?

## LinkedIn DM: Vivek Sharma / Movable Ink
**Target profile**: Vivek Sharma, CEO at Movable Ink. Search "Vivek Sharma Movable Ink" on LinkedIn. Recently partnered with STG (PE).

**DM text** (140 words):

Hey Vivek -- congrats on the STG partnership. The Autonomous Marketing Capabilities launch is the right direction -- AI agents for personalization at scale.

Under PE ownership, AI cost efficiency becomes a board-level metric. Marketing personalization generates enormous LLM volume, and most queries follow repeatable patterns across similar customer segments.

I built a system that exploits this:

- 4.3M agent dispatches/sec throughput
- 88% cache hit rate across similar customer segments
- 89% LLM cost reduction ($3,600/mo to $400/mo on one deployment)

For Movable Ink's scale, even a 30-40% optimization on the AI layer materially improves margins -- exactly what STG's portfolio model requires.

I have a live demo: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/

Worth a 30-minute discovery call?

## LinkedIn DM: Kevin McCarthy / Real Geeks
**Target profile**: Kevin McCarthy, CEO at Real Geeks. Search "Kevin McCarthy Real Geeks" on LinkedIn. CS background, early real estate AI adopter.

**DM text** (131 words):

Hey Kevin -- Real Geeks was one of the first real estate CRMs to adopt AI. That early investment compounds, but after years in production, there's usually room for a performance uplift.

I built a modern AI orchestration layer for real estate that addresses mature deployment pain points:

- 89% LLM cost reduction through 3-tier caching
- Multi-LLM orchestration with automatic fallback chains
- P50/P95/P99 latency tracking with configurable alerts

With your CS background, you'd appreciate the rigor: 8,500+ automated tests across 11 production repos, every system benchmarked at P50/P95/P99.

Would a 15-minute look at the architecture be useful? No sales pitch -- just showing what a modern caching layer looks like on top of an existing system.
