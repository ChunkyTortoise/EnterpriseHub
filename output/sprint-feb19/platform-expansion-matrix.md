|----------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|--------|
| **Contra** | 0.5 | 3-7 days | $1,000-$4,000 | 1 | Set up TODAY -- 0% commission, instant payouts, profile content ready |
| **Lemon Squeezy** | 1.0 | 7-14 days | $500-$2,000 | 2 | Upload top 3 products this week -- diversifies from Gumroad, better checkout UX |
| **Gun.io** | 1.5 | 2-4 weeks | $3,000-$8,000 | 3 | Apply this week -- vetted marketplace, premium clients, higher rates ($85-125/hr) |
| **Gumroad** | 0.5 | 7-14 days | $500-$3,000 | 4 | Upload queue ready (21 products) -- execute upload log NOW |
| **GitHub Sponsors** | 0.5 | 2-8 weeks | $50-$500 | 5 | Apply today -- low ceiling but zero marginal effort once live, brand signal |
| **Toptal** | 3.0 | 4-8 weeks | $5,000-$15,000 | 6 | Apply when bandwidth allows -- highest rates but 97% rejection rate, long screening |

## Platform Detail Cards

### 1. Contra (PRIORITY: HIGHEST)

- **Why first**: 0% commission (you keep 100%), instant account, profile content already written
- **Revenue model**: Service-based freelancing ($50-$2,000+ per project)
- **Competitive advantage**: Zero fees means you price 10-15% lower than Upwork competitors while earning more
- **Payout speed**: Debit card in 30 min, USDC instant, bank 0-3 days
- **Risk**: Smaller client pool than Upwork -- requires proactive marketing and community engagement
- **Content ready**: Full profile, 3 services, 3 portfolio items (see `contra-setup-checklist.md`)

### 2. Lemon Squeezy

- **Why second**: Digital product storefront with better checkout UX than Gumroad, growing creator economy platform
- **Revenue model**: Digital product sales ($29-$999 per product)
- **Competitive advantage**: Modern checkout, built-in affiliate system, EU VAT handling, lower fees than Gumroad for non-US buyers
- **Payout speed**: Payouts every 2 weeks via Stripe
- **Risk**: Newer platform, less organic discovery than Gumroad
- **Content ready**: Top 3 products selected (see `lemon-squeezy-listings-top3.md`)

### 3. Gun.io

- **Why third**: Vetted marketplace attracts premium enterprise clients willing to pay $85-150/hr
- **Revenue model**: Contract/hourly freelancing via vetted matching
- **Competitive advantage**: AI-powered matching reduces bidding; pre-qualified clients mean less proposal writing
- **Payout speed**: Standard invoicing cycle, reliable payments
- **Risk**: Vetting process may take 1-2 weeks; smaller job volume than Upwork
- **Content ready**: Full profile draft (see `gunio-profile-draft.md`)

### 4. Gumroad

- **Why fourth**: 21 products already in upload queue, just needs execution
- **Revenue model**: Digital product sales ($29-$1,499 per product)
- **Competitive advantage**: Established platform, strong SEO, newsletter/email integration
- **Payout speed**: Every Friday (PayPal) or bi-weekly (bank)
- **Risk**: 10% flat fee eats into margins; upload execution has been delayed
- **Content ready**: Full upload queue at `output/gumroad-upload-queue.json`, upload log at `output/gumroad-upload-log.md`

### 5. GitHub Sponsors

- **Why fifth**: Low effort, long-tail passive income, strong brand signal for open-source credibility
- **Revenue model**: Monthly sponsorship tiers ($5, $15, $50)
- **Competitive advantage**: Direct relationship with developers who use your tools; compounds with repo growth
- **Payout speed**: Monthly via Stripe (30-day holding period)
- **Risk**: Low absolute revenue unless repos gain significant traction; approval takes 2-7 days
- **Content ready**: Full setup package (see `github-sponsors-quickstart.md`)

### 6. Toptal

- **Why sixth**: Highest rates in freelancing ($100-200+/hr) but longest time-to-revenue
- **Revenue model**: Premium contract freelancing, no fee deducted from freelancer
- **Competitive advantage**: Pre-vetted clients, no bidding wars, steady long-term engagements
- **Payout speed**: Regular payroll cycle once engaged
- **Risk**: 97% rejection rate, 2-5 week multi-stage screening (language, technical test, live coding, test project)
- **Content ready**: Use Gun.io profile as base, adapt for Toptal's application format

## Revenue Projection (90-Day)

| Platform | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 | Notes |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Upwork (existing) | $1,500 | $2,500 | $3,500 | Proposals ramping, reviews compounding |
| Fiverr (existing) | $500 | $1,000 | $1,500 | 3 gigs live, more publishing |
| Contra (new) | $0 | $750 | $2,000 | Ramp after first completed project |
| Gumroad (new) | $200 | $400 | $600 | 21 products, organic discovery |
| Lemon Squeezy (new) | $100 | $250 | $400 | 3 products, cross-promote |
| Gun.io (new) | $0 | $2,000 | $4,000 | First engagement in month 2 |
| GitHub Sponsors (new) | $0 | $15 | $50 | Slow build, brand value |
| **Total** | **$2,300** | **$6,915** | **$12,050** | |

These are conservative estimates. A single Gun.io or Toptal engagement at $85-150/hr could add $5,000-$10,000/mo to month 2-3.

## Decision Framework

**If time is limited** (< 2 hours this week): Do Contra + GitHub Sponsors application only. Highest ROI per minute invested.

**If moderate time** (2-4 hours): Add Gumroad uploads + Lemon Squeezy top 3.

**If full sprint** (4+ hours): Complete all Week 1 actions plus Gun.io application.

**Skip for now**: Toptal (unless all other platforms are set up). The 2-5 week screening process means it is a background task, not an urgent one.
