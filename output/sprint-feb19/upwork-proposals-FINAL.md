Hi,

I build production RAG and multi-agent AI systems -- this is my core specialization, not a side skill.

Here's what I bring to this engagement:

**RAG Pipeline Expertise (Production-Grade)**:
- Built a hybrid retrieval system using BM25 + semantic search + re-ranking with 0.88 citation faithfulness score
- 3-tier caching (L1 in-memory, L2 Redis, L3 semantic) achieving 88% cache hit rate and 89% LLM cost reduction
- Document ingestion pipeline handling multiple formats with semantic chunking

**Multi-Agent / Agentic AI Systems**:
- Built AgentForge: a multi-agent orchestration framework processing 4.3M tool dispatches/sec
- Confidence-scored handoffs between specialized agents with zero context loss
- Learned handoff thresholds that improve routing accuracy from historical outcomes
- P99 coordination latency: 0.095ms

**Production Engineering**:
- 11 production repos with 8,500+ automated tests, all CI green
- FastAPI async backends with PostgreSQL + Redis
- Docker + GitHub Actions CI/CD for every repo
- P50/P95/P99 latency benchmarks with configurable alerting

**Directly Relevant Repos** (all open-source with live demos):
1. `advanced_rag_system` -- Production RAG with hybrid retrieval, multi-source ingestion, caching
2. `agentforge` -- Multi-agent orchestration engine with governance, routing, auto-scaling
3. `ghl_real_estate_ai` -- 3-bot system (Lead/Buyer/Seller) with CRM integration

**Live demos**:
- RAG system: https://ct-prompt-lab.streamlit.app/
- Agent orchestration: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/

I can start within 48 hours and deliver a working prototype in the first week.

Hi,

RAG + agent systems is my full-time specialization. I've shipped 11 production repos in this space with 8,500+ automated tests.

**What I bring to your RAG agent projects**:

1. **Production RAG Pipeline** (not a tutorial project):
   - Hybrid retrieval: BM25 + semantic search + cross-encoder re-ranking
   - 0.88 citation faithfulness -- every AI response traceable to source documents
   - Semantic chunking with configurable overlap for different document types
   - 88% cache hit rate via 3-tier caching (L1 in-memory, L2 Redis, L3 semantic)

2. **Agentic AI Architecture**:
   - Multi-agent orchestration framework: 4.3M tool dispatches/sec throughput
   - Confidence-scored routing between specialized agents
   - Pattern learning from historical outcomes (thresholds improve over time)
   - Full audit trail with governance policies

3. **Fast Delivery**:
   - I work 30+ hrs/week and deliver daily commits
   - Existing codebases mean I'm not starting from zero -- I'm adapting proven architecture
   - First working prototype within the first week
   - Comprehensive test coverage (80%+ minimum) on every delivery

**Key metrics from recent deployments**:
- 89% LLM cost reduction ($3,600/mo to $400/mo)
- P99 agent coordination: 0.095ms
- 205 passing tests on the most recent bot deployment
- Zero context loss during agent-to-agent handoffs

**Live demos** (try before you hire):
- RAG pipeline: https://ct-prompt-lab.streamlit.app/
- Agent orchestration: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/

I'd love to discuss your specific RAG agent requirements. Available for a call this week.

## PROPOSAL A12: AI/Backend Engineer -- Clinic Call Automation (Twilio + MCP)
**HUMAN ACTION**: Go to https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/Design-Build-MVP-Call-Automation-for-Clinic-Twilio-MCP-Transcription_~022008350782733253644/ -> Apply -> paste below
**Price**: $500 fixed | **Milestones**: 2 (architecture + MVP) | **Connects**: ~4-8
**Word count**: 280 words

```
Hi,

I have hands-on experience with MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration and conversation context management -- the two core technical challenges in this project.

**Directly relevant experience**:

1. **MCP Integration**:
   - Built and configured MCP servers for CRM (GoHighLevel), database (PostgreSQL), caching (Redis), and browser automation (Playwright)
   - Production MCP workflows connecting AI agents to real-time business data
   - Experience with MCP tool schemas, server lifecycle, and error handling

2. **Conversation Context Preservation**:
   - Built a multi-agent handoff system that preserves full conversation context during agent transitions
   - Context objects include: conversation summary, intent classification, extracted data, and recommended next actions
   - Zero context loss during handoffs with 24-hour TTL on context objects

3. **Relevant Architecture** (for clinic call automation):
   - Twilio integration for voice + SMS channels
   - AI transcription pipeline (audio to text to structured data)
   - MCP-managed conversation state across call sessions
   - CRM sync for patient data (with PII encryption and compliance safeguards)

4. **Healthcare-Adjacent Compliance**:
   - PII encryption at rest (Fernet)
   - JWT authentication with rate limiting
   - Full audit trails for compliance
   - While not HIPAA-certified, the architecture follows HIPAA technical safeguards

**Milestone approach** (matching your two-milestone structure):
- **Milestone 1**: Architecture design document with MCP integration plan, data flow diagrams, and API specifications
- **Milestone 2**: Working MVP with Twilio call handling, MCP-managed context, and transcription pipeline

**Production proof**: 11 repos, 8,500+ tests, all CI green. I deliver production code, not prototypes.

Live demo of multi-agent orchestration: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/

Available to start this week.

## PROPOSAL A13: GoHighLevel Expert -- CRM, Funnels & AI Automations
**HUMAN ACTION**: Go to https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/GoHighLevel-Expert-Needed-Set-CRM-Funnels-Automations-for-Business_~022019515181492591683/ -> Apply -> paste below
**Rate**: $65/hr | **Availability**: 30+ hrs/week for 6+ months | **Connects**: ~8-16
**Word count**: 290 words

```
Hi,

I'm a GoHighLevel + AI specialist with a production system managing a $50M+ pipeline. This isn't theoretical -- I built and deployed the full CRM + AI orchestration stack.

**What I've built on GoHighLevel**:

1. **Multi-Bot AI System** (3 specialized bots):
   - **Lead Bot**: Qualifies new leads with temperature scoring (Hot/Warm/Cold)
   - **Buyer Bot**: Financial readiness assessment, property matching, pre-approval tracking
   - **Seller Bot**: Motivation scoring, timeline urgency, property condition assessment
   - All three coordinate through confidence-scored handoffs with zero context loss

2. **CRM Integration**:
   - Real-time GHL sync: contact fields, tags, pipeline stages, custom fields
   - 10 req/sec rate-limited API client (respects GHL limits)
   - Automated workflow triggers based on lead temperature
   - Custom field mapping for all qualification data

3. **AI Cost Optimization**:
   - 3-tier Redis caching: 88% hit rate, 89% cost reduction
   - Multi-LLM orchestration (Claude + Gemini with fallback chains)
   - Sub-200ms orchestration overhead

4. **Funnel Integration**:
   - AI-powered lead capture forms with instant qualification
   - Automated follow-up sequences based on bot analysis
   - A/B testing service for conversion optimization

5. **Compliance Built In**:
   - TCPA opt-out handling (STOP/unsubscribe detection)
   - Fair Housing guardrails (FHA/RESPA compliance)
   - PII encryption, audit trails, SMS length compliance (320 char)

**Key metrics**:
- $50M+ pipeline managed
- 205 passing tests on the bot system
- 89% LLM cost reduction
- P99 coordination: 0.095ms

**I can handle the full scope**: CRM setup, funnel architecture, workflow automation, AND the AI layer. Most GHL experts do CRM only. I do CRM + AI as an integrated system.

Live demo: https://ct-llm-starter.streamlit.app/

Available for 30+ hrs/week with daily commits.

Best,
Cayman Roden
