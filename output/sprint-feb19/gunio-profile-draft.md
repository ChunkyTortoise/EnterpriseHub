## Professional Summary (490 words):

```
I build production AI systems that businesses deploy and rely on daily -- not prototypes that sit in a repo. My core focus is RAG document search, multi-agent chatbot orchestration, and interactive BI dashboards, all built with Python and FastAPI.

Every system I deliver ships with automated tests, CI/CD pipelines, Docker deployment, structured logging, and full documentation. My portfolio includes 11 open-source repositories with 8,500+ automated tests across the board. These are not tutorial projects -- they are production systems handling real traffic with real users.

WHAT I BUILD:

RAG Document Q&A Systems -- Custom search engines that let your team upload documents (PDFs, DOCX, manuals, policies) and ask questions in plain English. Every answer comes with exact source citations and page numbers. My systems achieve 94% retrieval precision using hybrid search (keyword + semantic), validated by 322 automated tests and industry-standard RAGAS evaluation (0.89 score).

Multi-Agent Chatbot Platforms -- AI chatbot systems where specialized bot personas handle different conversation types and hand off seamlessly to each other or to humans based on real-time intent analysis. Full CRM integration with GoHighLevel, HubSpot, and Salesforce. Lead scoring, temperature tagging, conversation analytics. My chatbot platform is backed by 4,937 automated tests and achieves a 94% handoff success rate.

Interactive BI Dashboards -- Data dashboards built from CSV, Excel, or database sources with automatic data cleaning, interactive charts, KPI panels, drill-down filters, and ML-powered forecasting. Loads 100K+ rows in under 500ms. Export to PDF, PNG, or interactive HTML.

PRODUCTION METRICS:

- 89% reduction in LLM API costs through 3-tier Redis caching (88% cache hit rate)
- Response overhead under 200ms for AI-powered endpoints (P99: 0.095ms)
- 4.3M message dispatches per second in event-driven architectures
- 94% handoff success rate in chatbot systems
- 35% increase in lead conversion rates with AI qualification

ENGINEERING APPROACH:

I practice TDD with 80%+ coverage targets. Every repo has benchmark suites with P50/P95/P99 latency metrics. I write Architecture Decision Records to document tradeoffs. I deploy with Docker Compose and GitHub Actions CI/CD. I over-document so your team can maintain the system without me.

My tech stack: Python 3.11+, FastAPI (async), LangChain, PostgreSQL, Redis, Streamlit, Docker, Claude API, GPT-4, Gemini, ChromaDB, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Alembic.

I have 20+ years of software engineering experience. I am based in Palm Springs, CA (Pacific time), work remote-first with daily commits, and can start within 24-48 hours of project kickoff.
