## GIG 4: Multi-Agent AI Workflow System
**HUMAN ACTION**: fiverr.com/selling/gigs/new -> paste fields below

**Gig Title** (55 chars):
I will build a multi-agent AI workflow system in Python

**Category Path**: Programming & Tech -> AI Development -> AI Applications

**Tags** (5, comma-separated):
multi-agent AI, AI workflow automation, LLM orchestration, autonomous AI agents, agentic AI

**Gig Description** (paste into editor):

**Stop building one-trick AI chatbots.** I'll architect and build a multi-agent AI workflow system where specialized agents coordinate to handle complex, multi-step tasks your single AI can't manage alone.

### What Is a Multi-Agent AI System?

Instead of one AI trying to do everything (and failing at complex tasks), you get:

- **A Lead Agent** that receives requests and delegates to specialists
- **Specialist Agents** for research, data retrieval, writing, analysis, or CRM actions
- **Handoff orchestration** with memory persistence across agents
- **Fallback logic** so one agent failure doesn't crash the whole workflow

This is how production AI actually works at companies like Salesforce, HubSpot, and EliseAI.

### What I Deliver:

- **Multi-agent architecture**: 2-5 specialized agents with clear roles and responsibilities
- **LLM orchestration**: Claude + GPT-4 + Gemini -- use the right model for each task
- **Conversation memory**: Context preserved across agent handoffs (zero re-qualification)
- **3-tier caching**: L1/L2/L3 Redis caching -- 89% LLM cost reduction verified in production
- **Confidence-scored routing**: Agents hand off only when confidence threshold is met (0.7+)
- **FastAPI backend**: Production-ready REST API for your workflow
- **Streamlit monitoring dashboard**: See agent activity, handoff rates, and costs in real time
- **Docker deployment**: Ready for any cloud provider

### Who This Is For:

- **Real estate tech**: Lead qualification bots that route buyers vs. sellers
- **Customer support**: Tier 1/2/3 routing with specialist resolution agents
- **Sales automation**: Lead scoring, CRM sync, and follow-up sequencing
- **Content pipelines**: Research -> draft -> review -> publish workflows
- **Data analysis**: Collection -> cleaning -> analysis -> reporting pipelines

### Why My Implementation Is Different:

- **8,500+ automated tests** across 11 production repositories
- **Benchmarked performance**: P99 latency: 0.095ms for agent coordination
- **4.3M tool dispatches/sec** throughput in production
- **89% LLM cost reduction** via 3-tier Redis caching (88% hit rate)
- **Zero context loss** on agent handoffs -- proven in a $50M+ real estate pipeline

**Have a complex AI task your current tools can't handle?** Message me with your use case and I'll tell you exactly how multi-agent architecture would solve it -- free consultation, 1-hour response.

**Pricing Tiers**:
| Tier | Name | Price | Delivery | Description |
|------|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Basic | 2-Agent Starter | $500 | 5 days | 2 specialized agents, handoff logic, confidence scoring, LLM integration, FastAPI endpoint, 20+ tests, Docker, 1 week support |
| Standard | 3-Agent Workflow | $1,000 | 7 days | 3 agents with bidirectional handoffs, multi-LLM routing, 3-tier Redis caching (50-89% cost reduction), CRM integration, Streamlit dashboard, 50+ tests, 2 weeks support |
| Premium | 5-Agent Production System | $2,000 | 10 days | Up to 5 agents with full mesh coordination, ReAct agent loop, A/B testing, P50/P95/P99 monitoring, alerting, rate limiting, circular prevention, 100+ tests, CI/CD, full docs, 1 month support |

**FAQ** (3 questions):
Q1: I already have a single LLM chatbot. Can you convert it to multi-agent?
A1: Yes, and this is one of the most common requests I get. I'll analyze your existing system, identify where it's struggling with complexity, and refactor it into a multi-agent architecture with minimal disruption to your current users. Basic tier works for most conversions.

Q2: How much will my LLM API costs increase with multiple agents?
A2: They'll likely decrease. The 3-tier caching architecture I implement in Standard and Premium means repeated queries across agents share cached results. In production, I've seen 89% cost reduction ($3,600/month to $400/month) with multi-agent systems vs. single-agent without caching.

Q3: Do you handle agent coordination or do I need to manage that?
A3: The orchestration layer is built for you. Agents coordinate automatically -- handoffs happen based on confidence scores, not manual routing rules. You interact with a single API endpoint; the multi-agent coordination is invisible to your end users.

## GIG 5: Content Flywheel Repurposing Service
**HUMAN ACTION**: fiverr.com/selling/gigs/new -> paste fields below

**Gig Title** (63 chars):
I will repurpose your technical content into 6 platform-optimized posts

**Category Path**: Writing & Translation -> Content Writing -> Articles & Blog Posts

**Tags** (5, comma-separated):
content repurposing, technical writing, LinkedIn content, developer marketing, content marketing

**Gig Description** (paste into editor):

Turn your existing blog post, case study, or technical documentation into 6 platform-specific content pieces -- each optimized for its platform's audience, format, and algorithm.

Stop cross-posting the same text everywhere. Each platform rewards different content styles. A LinkedIn post that performs well looks nothing like a Reddit post or a Twitter thread. I'll adapt your core message for maximum engagement on each platform.

### What I Deliver:

- **LinkedIn post** (300-500 words) -- Hook + data + engagement question format
- **Twitter/X thread** (7 tweets) -- Hook/data/CTA thread structure
- **Dev.to article** (1,500-2,500 words) -- Full technical article with code, SEO tags, and CTAs
- **Newsletter edition** (800-1,200 words) -- Personal voice, subject lines, P.S. upsell
- **Reddit post** -- Subreddit-appropriate tone, tl;dr, community-native format
- **YouTube video script** (5-8 min) -- Timestamps, talking points, description + tags

### Why Hire Me:

- AI/ML engineer with production portfolio (11 repos, 8,500+ tests)
- I understand developer audiences because I am one
- Every piece is written to sound native to the platform, not like a copy-paste
- Fast turnaround: 3-5 day delivery for a full batch

**Pricing Tiers**:
| Tier | Name | Price | Delivery | Description |
|------|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Basic | 3-Platform Bundle | $150 | 3 days | 1 topic, 3 platform outputs (you choose), platform-specific formatting, 1 revision |
| Standard | Full 6-Platform Suite | $300 | 5 days | 1 topic, all 6 platform outputs, engagement strategy notes, posting schedule, hashtag research, 2 revisions |
| Premium | 3-Topic Content Machine | $600 | 7 days | 3 topics x 6 platforms = 18 total pieces, 3-week publishing calendar, prepared engagement responses, cross-linking strategy, 30-min strategy call, 3 revisions |

**FAQ** (3 questions):
Q1: What kind of source content do you need?
A1: Blog posts, case studies, technical documentation, conference talks, README files, ADRs -- any substantial technical content (500+ words). The richer the source, the better the outputs.

Q2: Do you write for non-technical audiences?
A2: My specialty is developer/technical content, but the repurposing system works for any B2B or knowledge-worker audience. If your topic is technical (SaaS, AI/ML, DevOps, data), I'm your person.

Q3: Can I see examples?
A3: Yes. I'll share a portfolio of repurposed content from my own technical case studies (LLM cost optimization, multi-agent orchestration, RAG pipelines).

## GIG 6: GTM Workflow Builder (GoHighLevel + AI)
**HUMAN ACTION**: fiverr.com/selling/gigs/new -> paste fields below

**Gig Title** (74 chars):
I will build your AI-powered GTM workflow with GoHighLevel MCP integration

**Category Path**: Programming & Tech -> AI Development -> AI Agents

**Tags** (5, comma-separated):
GoHighLevel, GHL automation, AI agent, sales automation, CRM workflow

**Gig Description** (paste into editor):

### What's keeping you from closing more deals?

You're getting on calls. You're writing proposals by hand. You're manually updating your CRM. You're losing hours every week to work that an AI agent could do in minutes.

I build AI-powered GTM systems that connect directly to your GoHighLevel CRM -- not through Zapier, not through webhooks, but through a direct MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. This means AI agents that can **read your contacts, update fields, add tags, trigger workflows, and move deals through your pipeline in real time**.

**Here's what I'll build for you:**

- **Proposal-from-Transcript Agent**: Drop in a sales call recording or transcript, get a fully scoped proposal back with pricing, deliverables, and timeline -- automatically synced to your GHL contact record
- **ICP Definition Engine**: Analyze your last 20-50 closed contacts in GHL and generate a data-backed Ideal Customer Profile -- who to target, what messaging works, what disqualifies fast
- **Automated Workflows**: AI-triggered CRM sequences that score, tag, and route leads without manual work

I've built this exact system for my own agency and for clients -- it's not theoretical. My background: AI/ML engineer with 89% AI cost reduction results and $3M revenue impact on deployed systems. 205 passing tests on production code.

**Why this is different from a Zapier integration or a VA:**
- Agents reason about context, not just pass data between APIs
- GHL MCP means AI can act on CRM data without custom code per workflow
- Works with your existing GHL setup -- no migration, no new tools

**Pricing Tiers**:
| Tier | Name | Price | Delivery | Description |
|------|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Basic | GTM Starter | $2,500 | 28 days | GHL audit + MCP setup, Proposal-from-Transcript agent, ICP definition, 1 automated workflow, setup guide + runbook, 60-min handoff call, 2 revisions |
| Standard | GTM Growth | $3,500 | 35 days | Everything in Basic + 3 automated workflows, outreach personalization agent, weekly GTM digest, 30-day async support, prompt templates, 3 revisions |
| Premium | GTM Enterprise | $5,000 | 56 days | Everything in Standard + Revenue Intelligence Dashboard, multi-agent orchestration (full end-to-end), A/B test framework, custom MCP tool build, 90-day priority support, monthly strategy calls, unlimited revisions |

**FAQ** (3 questions):
Q1: Do I need a specific GoHighLevel plan?
A1: Any GHL plan works -- Agency Starter, Pro, or white-label. You just need API access (available on all plans).

Q2: Do I need to know how to code?
A2: No. I deliver everything ready to use. You'll get a runbook that explains how to run each agent in plain language. Optional: I can train your team on prompt modifications.

Q3: How much does it cost to run after delivery?
A3: AI API costs (Anthropic) are the main ongoing expense -- typically $5-30/month depending on volume. GHL subscription cost is separate and already yours. No monthly fee to me after delivery.
