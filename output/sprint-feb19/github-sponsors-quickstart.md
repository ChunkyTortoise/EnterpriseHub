# GitHub Sponsors Quickstart -- 10 Steps in 20 Minutes

**For**: Cayman Roden (github.com/ChunkyTortoise)
**Goal**: Get your GitHub Sponsors page live and start accepting sponsorships.

---

## Step 1: Verify Prerequisites (2 min)

Confirm 2FA is enabled at github.com/settings/security, your email is verified at github.com/settings/emails, and your profile bio/avatar/website are filled in at github.com/settings/profile.

---

## Step 2: Apply for GitHub Sponsors (2 min)

Go to github.com/sponsors/accounts and click "Get started" or "Join the waitlist." For the "Why do you need sponsorship?" field, paste:

```
I maintain 11 open-source repositories with 8,500+ tests, including mcp-server-toolkit (live on PyPI) and EnterpriseHub -- AI-powered real estate automation. Sponsorship funds ongoing maintenance, documentation, and new feature development for the developer community.
```

Select "Stripe Connect (Individual)" for payouts. Submit the application (approval typically takes 2-7 days).

---

## Step 3: Set Up Stripe Payouts (after approval, 3 min)

Once approved, go to github.com/sponsors/ChunkyTortoise/dashboard, click "Set up Stripe Connect," complete identity verification (government ID + bank account), and confirm payout settings. Payouts arrive monthly after a 30-day holding period.

---

## Step 4: Add Profile Bio (1 min)

Go to your Sponsors profile description and paste:

```
I build open-source developer tools and AI-powered applications. My work includes mcp-server-toolkit (live on PyPI), EnterpriseHub (real estate AI with 8,500+ tests), and 11 public repositories spanning FastAPI, Streamlit, PostgreSQL, and LLM integrations. Your sponsorship directly funds maintenance, new features, documentation, and keeping these tools free for the community. Every tier gets real benefits -- from README recognition to dedicated support calls.
```

## Step 5: Create Tier 1 -- Supporter ($5/mo) (1 min)

- Sponsor badge on your GitHub profile
- Priority release announcements via GitHub notifications
- Access to the #sponsors Discord channel
```

---

## Step 6: Create Tier 2 -- Builder ($15/mo) (1 min)

```
For developers and teams building on my projects.

Everything in Supporter, plus:
- 24-hour guaranteed response to your GitHub issues (business days)
- Builder sponsor badge on your GitHub profile
- Feature request prioritization on the roadmap
- Quarterly 30-minute video call for technical questions
- Early access to new features before public release
```

---

## Step 7: Create Tier 3 -- Enterprise ($50/mo) (1 min)

Create another tier and paste:

```
For organizations that need dedicated support and consultation.

Everything in Builder, plus:
- Monthly 30-minute consultation call (architecture review, integration guidance, or custom feature discussion)
- Dedicated Slack channel with direct access to me

```
