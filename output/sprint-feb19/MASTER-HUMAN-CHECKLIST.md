## WAVE 1: QUICK WINS (under 2 min each)

### 1.1 Publish LinkedIn Post #5 -- Ruff Linter (TODAY)
**Time**: ~2 min
**Source**: `output/sprint-feb19/linkedin-30day-calendar.md`
**Do this**:
1. Go to linkedin.com -> Start a post
2. Paste the content below
3. Click Post

**Embedded content**:
```
I just replaced 4 Python linters with one tool. And it's 10-100x faster.

Before:
black .          # Formatting
isort .          # Import sorting
flake8 .         # Linting
pylint .         # More linting
# Total: ~45 seconds on a 15K line codebase

After:
ruff check --fix .
ruff format .
# Total: <2 seconds

What is Ruff?

An "extremely fast Python linter" written in Rust. It replaces Black, isort, flake8, and most of pylint's rules.

Speed comparison on my codebase (15,000+ lines, 8,500+ tests):
- Old stack: 45 seconds
- Ruff: 1.8 seconds
- 25x faster

But speed isn't the only win.

Single config file:
No more juggling .flake8, pyproject.toml, .pylintrc, and .isort.cfg. Everything lives in one place.

Auto-fix by default:
Most linters just complain. Ruff fixes issues automatically (imports, line length, unused variables).

Drop-in replacement:
I migrated 5 repos in under an hour. Changed CI config, ran ruff check, committed fixes. Done.

Real results from my portfolio (10 repos, 30K+ lines):
- CI runtime: 12 min -> 4 min (67% reduction)
- Pre-commit hooks: 8 sec -> 0.4 sec
- Zero new dependencies (single binary)

How to migrate:

pip install ruff
ruff check . --fix  # Auto-fix issues
ruff format .       # Format code

One caveat: If you rely heavily on pylint's advanced checks (design patterns, code smells), keep it around. For most teams, Ruff's 700+ rules are enough.

Still running black + isort + flake8 separately? You're spending 10+ hours/year waiting on CI.

Try Ruff. Thank me later.

### 1.2 Publish LinkedIn Post #4 -- 3-Tier Caching (TODAY, was Mon Feb 17)
**Time**: ~2 min
**Source**: `output/ACTION-TODAY-2026-02-19.md`
**Do this**:
1. Go to linkedin.com -> Start a post
2. Paste the content below
3. Click Post (space this at least 1 hour after Post #5)

**Embedded content**:
```
I spent $847 on AI agent conversations before I figured out memory was the problem.

Here's what was happening:

Every time a user asked "What did I say earlier?" the agent re-processed the entire conversation history. 200+ messages. Every. Single. Time.

That's 50K+ tokens per query. At GPT-4 pricing, it adds up fast.

The fix? A 3-tier memory cache:

- L1 (in-process): Last 10 messages, <1ms retrieval
- L2 (Redis): Last 100 messages, <5ms retrieval
- L3 (Postgres): Full history, semantic search when needed

Results after 30 days:
- 89% cost reduction ($847 -> $93/month)
- 88% cache hit rate (most queries never touch the database)
- P95 latency: 4.8ms (vs. 180ms before)

Key lesson: Most agent memory access is sequential. You don't need a vector database for everything. Start simple, add complexity only when needed.

Question for AI engineers: How are you handling memory in your agent systems? Vector DB? Fine-tuning? Something else?

### 1.4 Post Flywheel Content -- Twitter/X LLM Cost Thread (TODAY)
**Time**: ~5 min
**Source**: `output/sprint-feb19/flywheel-distribution-schedule.md`
**Do this**:
1. Go to twitter.com/x.com -> Compose tweet
2. Post as a 7-tweet thread. Tweet 1 (hook):

**Tweet 1**: Our AI agent was burning $12K/month on Claude API calls. 500 active leads. 3 bots. 6,000 daily interactions. We cut it to $1,300/month with a 3-tier caching strategy. Here's the full breakdown: [thread]

**Tweet 2**: The problem: every conversation turn hit the API. Lead scoring: 2,000 tokens. Intent classification: 1,500 tokens. Response generation: 3,000 tokens. Memory retrieval: 1,000 tokens. = 7,500 tokens per interaction = $12K/month at Claude pricing

**Tweet 3**: We logged 10,000 queries over 7 days. The data: 74% referenced the last 10 messages. 14% referenced the last 100 messages. Only 12% needed full semantic search. 90% of queries were "what did I just say?" not "what have we discussed over 3 weeks?"

**Tweet 4**: So we built a 3-tier cache: L1 (RAM): Last 10 messages. <1ms. 74% hit rate. L2 (Redis): Last 100 messages. <5ms. 14% hit rate. L3 (Postgres+pgvector): Full history. <50ms. 12% hit rate. 88% of queries never touch the LLM.

**Tweet 5**: 30-day production results: Cost: $12K -> $1,300 (-89%). Cost/lead: $24 -> $2.60. P95 latency: 180ms -> 4.8ms. Conversion: +7%. The conversion boost was unexpected -- sub-200ms SMS responses feel instant. 1.2s feels like a bot.

**Tweet 6**: 3 hard-won lessons: 1. Start with Redis (L2), not in-memory. L2 gave 80% of the value. 2. Monitor cache FRESHNESS, not just hit rates. Stale cache = wrong scores. 3. Set TTLs by data volatility. Market context = 60 min. Lead intent = 5 min.

**Tweet 7**: Before you fine-tune a model or build RAG -- check if it's a caching problem. Full architecture + production code: github.com/ChunkyTortoise/EnterpriseHub. Open source. MIT license. Questions? Reply or DM.

**Success criteria**: 7-tweet thread live on Twitter/X.

### 1.5 Post Flywheel Content -- Twitter/X Multi-Agent Thread (TODAY)
**Time**: ~5 min
**Source**: `output/sprint-feb19/flywheel-distribution-schedule.md`
**Do this**: Post second 7-tweet thread on multi-agent orchestration (same process as above).

**Tweet 1**: I built a system where chatbots decide which chatbot should answer. 3 bots. Real estate lead qualification. The hard part wasn't the bots -- it was the handoffs between them. Here's what broke and how I fixed it: [thread]

**Tweet 2**: When a lead says "I'm thinking about selling" during a buyer flow, the system needs to: 1. Detect intent shift (0.7 confidence) 2. Package conversation context 3. Route to Seller Bot 4. Prevent circular routing. Sounds simple. It's not.

**Tweet 3-7**: (Continue thread from flywheel schedule -- covers handoff loops, context loss, rate abuse, fixes, production results, and open source link)

### 2.5 Send Upwork Follow-Ups A1, A2, A3, A5, A8, A9 (10 min)
**Time**: ~10 min
**Source**: `output/sprint-feb19/upwork-followups-complete.md`
**Do this**: Go to Upwork -> Messages -> find each conversation thread -> paste follow-up.

**A1 -- Claude Code AI Agent Architect** (OVERDUE):
```
Hi -- wanted to follow up on my Claude Code agent architect proposal. Since submitting, I shipped a 3-bot AI system with confidence-scored handoffs and full MCP integration -- essentially the same orchestration pattern your YouTube content pipeline needs. The system runs 205 automated tests and handles 4.3M tool dispatches/sec. If you're still looking for someone who builds autonomous agent pipelines (not just prompt wrappers), I'd love to chat. Available for a quick call anytime this week.
```

**A2 -- Claude API/MCP for MSP Operations** (OVERDUE):
```
Hi -- circling back on the Claude API/MCP integration role for MSP operations. I recently completed an MCP server deployment connecting Claude to GoHighLevel CRM, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Playwright -- all running in production with real client data. The pattern of wiring Claude to business-specific tools via MCP is exactly what MSP operations need. I'm available 30+ hrs/week and can start within 48 hours. Happy to walk through the architecture on a quick call if that's helpful.
```

**A3 -- Full Stack Python + Claude Code** (OVERDUE):
```
Hi -- following up on the full stack Python + Claude Code position. Quick update: I just wrapped a production deployment with FastAPI async backends, PostgreSQL + Redis caching, and Claude orchestration -- 8,500+ tests across 11 repos, all CI green. The stack matches what you're building. I work 30+ hrs/week with daily commits and can ramp up same-week. Let me know if you'd like to do a quick technical screen -- happy to share screen and walk through the codebase.
```

**A5 -- Python LLM Workflow Developer** (OVERDUE):
```
Hi -- wanted to circle back on the Python LLM workflow developer role. Since submitting, I just finished benchmarking a 3-tier LLM caching layer that cut API costs 89% on a production agent system -- the architecture doc is on my GitHub if you want to see the numbers. That kind of cost-conscious workflow engineering is what I'd bring to the contract-to-hire. If you're still evaluating candidates, I'm available for a 15-minute technical screen anytime this week.
```

**A8 -- RAG Chatbot with Custom LLMs** (OVERDUE):
```
Hi -- following up on the RAG chatbot project. Since my proposal, I completed a production RAG deployment with hybrid BM25 + semantic retrieval and 0.88 citation faithfulness -- meaning every AI response is traceable to source documents. The system supports custom LLM routing (Claude, Gemini, open-source models) with automatic fallback chains. If you need a chatbot that actually cites its sources reliably, that's exactly what I've built. Live demo here if you want to try it: https://ct-prompt-lab.streamlit.app/ -- happy to discuss your specific requirements.
```

**A9 -- Hybrid Graph RAG/LLM Engineer** (OVERDUE):
```
Hi -- wanted to send a combined follow-up since I submitted a while back. Two updates since my proposal: (1) I deployed a production RAG system with hybrid retrieval (BM25 + semantic + re-ranking) achieving 0.88 citation faithfulness, and (2) I've been working with knowledge graph integrations for entity relationship extraction alongside vector search. The graph + RAG hybrid approach you're building is where retrieval is heading -- I'd bring both working code and architectural perspective. If the role is still open, I'm available for a technical conversation anytime. Portfolio: https://chunkytortoise.github.io
```

**Success criteria**: 6 follow-up messages sent in Upwork message threads.

### 3.2 Send 5 LinkedIn DMs -- Batch 2 Top Contacts (15 min)
**Time**: ~15 min (3 min each)
**Source**: `output/sprint-feb19/linkedin-dm-batch2-top5.md`
**Do this**: For each contact, send a connection request first (if not connected), then send the DM once accepted.

**DM 1 -- Rick Nucci / Guru** (search "Rick Nucci Guru" on LinkedIn):
```
Hey Rick -- congrats on Guru hitting 10 years and crossing $63M. Building an AI Source of Truth that enterprises actually trust is rare.

Quick thought: knowledge management queries are among the most cacheable AI workloads. "How does our expense policy work?" gets asked hundreds of times with slight variations across your customer base.

I built a caching system that catches these semantic duplicates -- 88% hit rate, 89% LLM cost reduction. At Guru's revenue, even a 30% AI cost savings is material.

With your Boomi background, you'd appreciate the rigor: the semantic layer detects "What's our PTO policy?" and "How many vacation days do I get?" are the same query.

Would a 15-minute walkthrough be useful? No pitch -- just architecture patterns.

Cayman Roden | caymanroden@gmail.com
```

**DM 2 -- Mike Murchison / Ada** (search "Mike Murchison Ada"):
```
Hey Mike -- Ada's Reasoning Engine solving resolution + upselling in one agent is the right bet. Most chatbots can barely handle one of those.

At unicorn scale, LLM cost efficiency becomes a board-level metric. Customer service queries are among the most cacheable AI workloads -- "Where's my order?" gets asked millions of times with minor variations.

I built a multi-agent system with results relevant to Ada's architecture:

- 88% cache hit rate via semantic caching
- 89% LLM cost reduction
- Confidence-scored handoffs between agents with zero context loss

Even a 20-30% improvement on LLM costs at Ada's scale saves millions annually.

I have a live demo if you're curious: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/

Worth a 30-minute call?

Cayman | caymanroden@gmail.com
```

**DM 3 -- Joe Chen / Lofty** (search "Joe Chen Lofty" or "Joe Chen Chime Technologies"):
```
Hey Joe -- the Chime-to-Lofty rebrand makes strategic sense. The AI Workforce concept -- multi-agent, predictive, always-on -- is exactly where real estate tech is heading.

I built the infrastructure layer that makes multi-agent real estate AI actually work at scale:

- 89% LLM cost reduction via 3-tier caching
- Sub-200ms orchestration for multi-agent coordination
- Learned handoff thresholds that improve from historical outcomes

For Lofty's AI Workforce, this means faster responses, lower per-conversation costs, and smarter agent-to-agent handoffs as your platform scales.

I have a live demo of the orchestration engine if you'd like to see it in action.

Open to a 15-minute call?

Cayman Roden | caymanroden@gmail.com
```

**DM 4 -- Vivek Sharma / Movable Ink** (search "Vivek Sharma Movable Ink"):
```
Hey Vivek -- congrats on the STG partnership. The Autonomous Marketing Capabilities launch is the right direction -- AI agents for personalization at scale.

Under PE ownership, AI cost efficiency becomes a board-level metric. Marketing personalization generates enormous LLM volume, and most queries follow repeatable patterns across similar customer segments.

I built a system that exploits this:

- 4.3M agent dispatches/sec throughput
- 88% cache hit rate across similar customer segments
- 89% LLM cost reduction ($3,600/mo to $400/mo on one deployment)

For Movable Ink's scale, even a 30-40% optimization on the AI layer materially improves margins -- exactly what STG's portfolio model requires.

I have a live demo: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/

Worth a 30-minute discovery call?

Cayman | caymanroden@gmail.com
```

**DM 5 -- Kevin McCarthy / Real Geeks** (search "Kevin McCarthy Real Geeks"):
```
Hey Kevin -- Real Geeks was one of the first real estate CRMs to adopt AI. That early investment compounds, but after years in production, there's usually room for a performance uplift.

I built a modern AI orchestration layer for real estate that addresses mature deployment pain points:

- 89% LLM cost reduction through 3-tier caching
- Multi-LLM orchestration with automatic fallback chains
- P50/P95/P99 latency tracking with configurable alerts

With your CS background, you'd appreciate the rigor: 8,500+ automated tests across 11 production repos, every system benchmarked at P50/P95/P99.

Would a 15-minute look at the architecture be useful? No sales pitch -- just showing what a modern caching layer looks like on top of an existing system.
