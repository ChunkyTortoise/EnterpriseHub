# Tier 1 Quick-Win Proposals — Ready to Paste

**How to use**: Find a matching job on Upwork. Copy the relevant template. Fill in all [BRACKETS]. Keep it under 150 words. Submit.

**Key rule**: Never lead with experience level. Always lead with delivery date and what you'll build.

---

## Template 1 — Python Script (Data Cleaning / File Automation / Scraping)

> **Best for**: "I need a Python script to...", "automate my spreadsheet", "scrape website X"
> **Bid range**: $150–$400 | **Delivery**: 1–2 days

---

I build exactly this.

[1-sentence paraphrase of what they need, e.g., "A Python script that reads your CSV, removes duplicates, and outputs a clean file with a summary report."]

Here's my approach:
1. [Step 1 — input/source, e.g., "Read your CSV or connect to your Google Sheet"]
2. [Step 2 — processing, e.g., "Clean and transform using pandas — flag anomalies, fill gaps, deduplicate"]
3. [Step 3 — output, e.g., "Output clean CSV + a simple log of what changed"]

I can deliver a working version by [DATE — 1-2 days from today]. Fixed price, one revision included, clean commented code so you can maintain it yourself.

I've built [RELEVANT PROOF: e.g., "data pipeline tools processing 50K+ rows with full test suites — CI green"]. Happy to share examples.

One question: [CLARIFYING Q, e.g., "Is the input always a CSV, or do you also need Excel (.xlsx) support?"]

---

## Template 2 — Spreadsheet / Google Sheets Automation

> **Best for**: "automate my Google Sheet", "Excel macro", "copy data between sheets", "auto-format report"
> **Bid range**: $100–$300 | **Delivery**: 1 day

---

I can have this done tomorrow.

[1-sentence paraphrase, e.g., "A Google Apps Script that automatically pulls your weekly sales data, formats the report, and emails it to your team every Monday morning."]

My approach:
1. [Step 1, e.g., "Build the Apps Script trigger + pull data from your source sheet"]
2. [Step 2, e.g., "Apply your formatting rules and generate the summary tab"]
3. [Step 3, e.g., "Send via Gmail with the formatted sheet attached — no manual steps needed"]

Delivery: [DATE — tomorrow]. Includes a 5-min Loom walkthrough so you understand exactly how it works. Fixed price, one revision.

Quick question: [CLARIFYING Q, e.g., "Is this Google Sheets, Excel, or do you need both?"]

---

## Template 3 — Simple FAQ Chatbot (Website Widget)

> **Best for**: "I need a chatbot for my website", "FAQ bot", "customer service bot basic"
> **Bid range**: $300–$600 | **Delivery**: 1–2 days

---

I build exactly this.

[1-sentence paraphrase, e.g., "A chatbot widget for your website that answers common questions about your services, captures leads, and hands off to you when it doesn't know the answer."]

Here's what I'll deliver:
1. [Step 1, e.g., "Configure Typebot (free tool, no monthly fees for you) with your FAQ content"]
2. [Step 2, e.g., "Embed the widget on your site — works on any CMS (WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace, raw HTML)"]
3. [Step 3, e.g., "Set up email/Slack alert when a lead fills out the contact form inside the chat"]

Live and working by [DATE — 1-2 days]. I'll record a Loom showing you how to update the answers yourself going forward. Fixed price, one revision.

One question: [CLARIFYING Q, e.g., "How many FAQ questions do you want it to handle, and do you need it to capture email addresses from visitors?"]

---

## Template 4 — GoHighLevel (GHL) Workflow / Automation Setup

> **Best for**: "GHL automation", "GoHighLevel workflow", "CRM automation", "GHL pipeline setup"
> **Bid range**: $300–$700 | **Delivery**: 1–3 days

---

GHL automation is something I do regularly — I can get this moving fast.

[1-sentence paraphrase, e.g., "Set up your lead intake workflow: new contact from your form → tag by source → send SMS + email sequence → notify your team → move to the right pipeline stage automatically."]

My approach:
1. [Step 1, e.g., "Map your current manual process and identify the trigger (form, webhook, tag, etc.)"]
2. [Step 2, e.g., "Build the workflow with branching logic, delay steps, and your message templates"]
3. [Step 3, e.g., "Test end-to-end with a dummy contact, document the flow, hand it off to you"]

Delivery: [DATE — 1-3 days depending on complexity]. I recently built [PROOF POINT: e.g., "a 3-workflow GHL automation system with 22 custom fields and pipeline management for a real estate agent"] — happy to walk you through it.

Quick question: [CLARIFYING Q, e.g., "What triggers the workflow — a form submission, an inbound call, or something else?"]

---

## Template 5 — API Connection (Connect Two Tools via REST)

> **Best for**: "connect App A to App B", "webhook integration", "API glue script", "Zapier replacement custom"
> **Bid range**: $200–$500 | **Delivery**: 1–2 days

---

I can build this connection cleanly — no middleware fees, no Zapier dependency.

[1-sentence paraphrase, e.g., "A lightweight Python script that listens for new orders in [Tool A], formats the data, and pushes it to [Tool B] via their REST API — runs on a schedule or on webhook trigger."]

Here's the plan:
1. [Step 1, e.g., "Authenticate with both APIs and test the connection (usually 1-2 hours)"]
2. [Step 2, e.g., "Build the transformation logic — map fields from Tool A format to Tool B format"]
3. [Step 3, e.g., "Deploy as a simple script (can run on your server, a free cloud function, or a $5 VPS)"]

Working integration by [DATE — 1-2 days]. Code is clean, commented, and testable. Fixed price, one revision. I'll include a README so you or anyone on your team can modify it later.

One question: [CLARIFYING Q, e.g., "Do both tools have public REST APIs with documentation, or is one of them a custom/internal system?"]

---

## Bonus: Universal Closer (Add to Any Template)

Use this if the job has received many proposals already:

> "If you'd like to move quickly, I'm available to start today. Happy to share a relevant code sample from my GitHub before you commit."

## Quick Reference: Proof Points to Cite by Gig Type

| Gig Type | Best Proof Point |
|----------|-----------------|
| Python script | "11 production Python repos on GitHub, all CI green, 8,500+ automated tests" |
| Spreadsheet automation | "Built pandas data pipelines processing 50K+ rows with anomaly detection" |
| Simple chatbot | "3 live chatbot deployments including CRM-synced lead capture" |
| GHL automation | "Recently built full GHL automation system: 3 workflows, 22 custom fields, pipeline management for real estate client" |
| API connection | "Built 3 CRM integrations (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce) via unified REST protocol — all production, all tested" |

## Rate Card for Quick Wins

| Job Size | Pricing |
|----------|---------|
| Script under 100 lines | $150–$250 |
| Script with data transformation | $200–$400 |
| Chatbot (FAQ, no AI) | $300–$500 |
| Chatbot (with AI/LLM) | $500–$800 |
| GHL workflow (1-2 workflows) | $300–$500 |
| GHL workflow (3+ workflows, custom fields) | $500–$700 |
| API connection (public APIs) | $200–$400 |
| API connection (complex auth/transformation) | $350–$600 |

**Rule**: Never bid less than $150 (signals desperation). Never bid more than $800 on a Tier 1 quick-win (slows decision).

## What to Do When You Don't Know the Tool

If the client mentions a tool you haven't used (e.g., a specific CRM, niche SaaS):

1. Look up their public API docs quickly (5 min)
2. If it's REST + JSON → you can build it, say so
3. If it's SOAP or obscure → skip the job

Template addition:
> "I checked [Tool]'s API documentation — it's a standard REST API and this connection is straightforward. No blockers."
