# Gumroad Upload Log

**Created**: [2026-02-19 12:00]
**Status**: PENDING -- HUMAN LOGIN REQUIRED (Gate G1)
**Queue file**: output/gumroad-upload-queue.json (21 products)

## Gate G1 Blocker

**Reason**: Browser automation unavailable -- Playwright failed to launch (existing Chrome session conflict) and Chrome extension not connected.
**Required human action**: Login at https://gumroad.com and either:
1. Open Chrome with the Claude extension connected, OR
2. Close existing Chrome sessions so Playwright can launch a fresh browser

**Once logged in**: Re-run gumroad-uploader agent to resume automated uploads.

## Verification Report (Task 2.5)

**Date**: [2026-02-19]
**Method**: Gumroad MCP (read-only) -- UNAVAILABLE
**Reason**: The `gumroad-mcp` server is configured in `.mcp.json` but was not loaded in this agent session. The `GUMROAD_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable may not be set.

### Verification Status

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Gumroad MCP available | NO -- tool not loaded in session |
| Products queried via API | NOT POSSIBLE |
| Products live on Gumroad | 0 (all uploads blocked by Gate G1) |
| Queue file valid | YES -- output/gumroad-upload-queue.json has 21 entries |
| Upload log complete | YES -- all 21 products documented with status PENDING |
| Revenue tracker updated | YES -- full inventory added to revenue-tracker.md |

### Local Asset Verification

| Asset | Exists | Count |
|-------|--------|-------|
| output/gumroad-upload-queue.json | YES | 21 entries |
| output/gumroad-products/agentforge.zip | YES | 1 file |
| output/gumroad-products/docqa-engine.zip | YES | 1 file |
| output/gumroad-products/insight-engine.zip | YES | 1 file |
| output/gumroad-products/scrape-and-serve.zip | YES | 1 file |
| content/gumroad/GUMROAD_UPLOAD_MANIFEST.md | YES | 18 products + 3 bundles |

### Missing ZIPs (Need to Build Before Upload)

Products #1, #2, #15-18 reference source directories (`prompt-engineering-lab/`, `llm-integration-starter/`) rather than pre-built ZIPs. These ZIPs need to be built from source before upload. The 4 existing ZIPs cover products #3-14 and #19-20.

### Re-verification Instructions

Once products are uploaded, run verification by:
1. Ensure `GUMROAD_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set in environment
2. Restart agent session so `gumroad-mcp` loads
3. Query Gumroad API for product list
4. Compare returned products against the 21 entries in `output/gumroad-upload-queue.json`
5. Verify each product has: correct name, price, slug, published status
