```
To: mark@evercred.com
Subject: AI Agent Infrastructure — LLM Agents + ML Ops Background

Hi Mark,

Your Technical Co-Founder posting caught my attention — I've built
exactly this: multi-agent orchestration systems with production
deployment, monitoring, and cost optimization.

Relevant work:
- AgentForge: 4.3M tool dispatches/sec, <200ms P99 orchestration
- Production RAG system with hybrid BM25 + semantic search
- 3-tier Redis caching achieving 88% hit rate, 89% cost reduction
- 454 tests across a healthcare-adjacent AI bot system

I'm remote (Palm Springs, CA), available immediately, and deeply
aligned with the "AI agents in production" mission.
