  title: "Real Estate Lead Qualification Automation"
  service_ids:
    - "S04"
    - "S06"
    - "S08"
    - "S10"
  industry: "Real Estate"
  problem: |
    A real estate brokerage in Rancho Cucamonga was losing 40% of leads due to slow response times.
    Manual qualification took 45+ minutes per lead, and agents struggled to prioritize high-value prospects.
    The existing process relied on human review of lead forms, with no automated scoring or routing.
    This resulted in missed opportunities, wasted agent time on low-quality leads, and poor customer experience.
  constraints:
    - "Must integrate with existing GoHighLevel CRM"
    - "5-minute response SLA requirement"
    - "Support English and Spanish leads"
    - "Maintain data privacy and compliance (DRE, Fair Housing)"
    - "Budget constraints requiring cost-effective AI implementation"
  solution: |
    Built a multi-agent AI system with three specialized bots (Lead, Seller, and Buyer) using a Q0-Q4
    qualification framework. The Lead Bot performs initial qualification, the Seller Bot handles property
    listing inquiries, and the Buyer Bot assists with property search and financing questions.

    Implemented 3-tier Redis caching (L1/L2/L3) for 89% cost reduction on AI API calls. Integrated with
    GoHighLevel CRM for real-time lead sync and temperature tag publishing (Hot-Lead, Warm-Lead, Cold-Lead).

    Added Streamlit BI dashboard for visibility into lead flow, bot performance, and conversion metrics.
    The system includes A/B testing for prompt optimization, handoff orchestration with circular prevention,
    and comprehensive monitoring with alerting.

    The architecture uses FastAPI for async API endpoints, PostgreSQL for data persistence, Redis for caching,
    and Claude API for AI orchestration. All components are containerized with Docker Compose for easy deployment.

  industry: "Marketing Technology / SaaS"
  problem: |
    A marketing agency and SaaS company were struggling to track marketing ROI across multiple channels.
    Fragmented data sources made it impossible to attribute revenue to specific campaigns, resulting in
    wasted ad spend and poor optimization decisions. Manual reporting took 20+ hours per week, and the
    team lacked visibility into which marketing activities were actually driving revenue.

    Key pain points included:
    - No unified view of marketing performance across channels
    - Inability to track lead-to-revenue conversion
    - Manual proposal generation taking 45+ minutes per opportunity
    - Poor lead qualification resulting in low response rates
    - No automated competitor monitoring or market intelligence
  constraints:
    - "Must integrate with existing Upwork RSS feeds for lead sourcing"
    - "LinkedIn API rate limits requiring batch processing"
    - "Budget constraints requiring cost-effective AI implementation"
    - "7-day delivery timeline for initial MVP"
    - "Zero framework lock-in requirement for flexibility"
  solution: |
    Built a comprehensive revenue optimization platform in 7 days with 212 tests and a full freelancer
    revenue engine. The solution includes:

    1. **4-Agent Proposal Pipeline**: Automated prospecting → credential sync → proposal architect →
       engagement analysis workflow that generates personalized proposals in 3-7 seconds per job.

    2. **Upwork RSS Scanner**: 105-point scoring rubric with SQLite persistence that evaluates opportunities
       based on budget, client history, job complexity, and fit criteria.

    3. **LinkedIn Outreach Engine**: Personalized message generation with batch export capabilities,
       enabling scalable outreach with high response rates.

    4. **Three Packaged Products**: Prompt injection suite ($99), RAG cost optimizer ($149), and multi-agent
       orchestrator ($199) - all production-ready with documentation.

    5. **Marketing Attribution Dashboard**: Unified view of campaign performance with multi-touch
       attribution, ROI analysis, and automated reporting.

    The system runs on a minimal Python stack with zero framework lock-in, using SQLite for persistence,
    and includes comprehensive test coverage (212 passing tests). All components are containerized with
    Docker for easy deployment.

  title: "Advanced RAG System for Marketing Intelligence"
  service_ids:
    - "S03"
    - "S08"
    - "S15"
  industry: "Marketing Technology / Data Analytics"
  problem: |
    A marketing agency was unable to effectively query their extensive corpus of marketing data, campaign reports,
    and performance analytics. The team relied on manual keyword searches across disconnected documents, resulting in
    slow data retrieval (5-10 minutes per query), poor contextual understanding, and missed insights. Marketing analysts
    spent 30+ hours per week manually compiling reports from scattered sources, and the lack of semantic search
    capabilities meant that related concepts and trends were frequently overlooked.

    Key pain points included:
    - No natural language interface for querying marketing data
    - Slow data retrieval times (5-10 minutes per query)
    - Inability to find related concepts through semantic search
    - Fragmented data sources requiring manual compilation
    - Lack of contextual understanding in search results
  constraints:
    - "Must handle large document corpus (10,000+ marketing documents)"
    - "Sub-100ms response time requirement for real-time queries"
    - "90%+ retrieval accuracy requirement for business-critical queries"
    - "Budget constraints requiring cost-effective AI implementation"
    - "Must support multi-modal data (text, tables, images from reports)"
  solution: |
    Built an enterprise-grade Advanced RAG System with hybrid retrieval, multi-modal support, and production-grade
    performance optimization. The solution includes:

    1. **Hybrid Retrieval Engine**: Combines dense vector embeddings (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large) with sparse BM25
       retrieval, fused using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for optimal result ranking.

    2. **Advanced Query Processing**: Implements query classification, HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) for
       complex queries, and multi-query expansion for ambiguous searches.

    3. **Cross-Encoder Re-ranking**: Uses Cohere Rerank v3 for fine-grained relevance scoring, improving retrieval
       accuracy by 25% over baseline.

    4. **Multi-Layer Caching**: L1 in-memory cache (sub-millisecond), L2 Redis cache (1-5ms), and L3 persistent cache
       with semantic similarity matching, achieving 95%+ cache hit rates.

    5. **Contextual Compression**: Reduces token usage by 50% through intelligent content extraction and filtering,
       lowering LLM costs while maintaining answer quality.

    6. **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework**: Automated benchmarking with faithfulness detection, retrieval accuracy
       metrics (Recall@K, NDCG), and LLM-as-judge for answer relevance scoring.

    7. **Production Observability**: Prometheus metrics collection, Grafana dashboards, distributed tracing with
       OpenTelemetry, and structured logging with correlation IDs.

    The system is built with FastAPI for async API endpoints, ChromaDB for vector storage, Redis for caching, and
    includes comprehensive test coverage with pytest. All components are containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
