## 2. About Section (The "Sales Letter")
**Headline:** Scaling Real Estate Brokerages with 24/7 AI Lead Qualification.

Most real estate brokerages lose 40% of their leads because it takes longer than 5 minutes to reply. In 2026, if you aren't responding in seconds, you're invisible.

I help brokerage owners and growth-focused agencies reclaim their time and revenue by deploying multi-agent AI systems that never sleep.

**What I do:**
I design and ship production-grade AI agents (like the "Jorge Bot" ecosystem) that integrate directly into your GoHighLevel CRM. My systems don't just "chat"—they qualify leads using custom Q0-Q4 frameworks, score them for "Hot/Cold" intent, and route them to your top agents instantly.

**The Results (CS001 Case Study):**
*   **95% Faster Response:** Reduced from 45 minutes to 2 minutes.
*   **133% Conversion Lift:** Increased lead-to-close rates from 12% to 28%.
*   **$240k Annual Savings:** Eliminated the need for manual 24/7 lead screening.
*   **89% Cost Efficiency:** Using 3-tier Redis caching to keep AI API costs negligible.

**Who I work with:**
*   Real Estate Brokerage Owners scaling to 50+ agents.
*   Marketing Agencies needing "AI-as-a-Service" for their clients.
*   SaaS Founders looking to optimize LLM performance and costs.

**Certifications & Trust:**
19+ Technical Certifications from Google, IBM, Meta, and Vanderbilt in AI Strategy, Data Analytics, and Deep Learning.
