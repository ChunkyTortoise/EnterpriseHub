## The AI Feedback Loop (Iterate with me)
To maximize your results, use me for the following weekly tasks:
1.  **Objection Analysis:** "I had a call today and they said [Objection]. How should I rewrite my offer to address this?"
2.  **Copy Optimization:** "My LinkedIn posts are getting views but no DMs. Here is my latest post—how can I make the CTA stronger?"
3.  **Offer Design:** "The client wants a feature for [Specific Use Case]. How do I price this as a value-based offer instead of hourly?"

## Final Success Metric (Day 90)
You should have:
1.  A fully automated "Top of Funnel" (LinkedIn + Community).
2.  3-5 High-quality Case Studies with quantified ROI.
3.  A predictable pipeline of Discovery Calls.
4.  At least 2 Recurring Revenue streams (Retainers).
