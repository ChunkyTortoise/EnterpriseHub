## Featured Case Study

### Real Estate Lead Qualification Automation

**Problem:** A real estate brokerage was losing 40% of leads due to slow response times. Manual qualification took 45+ minutes per lead, and agents struggled to prioritize high-value prospects.

**Solution:** Built a multi-agent AI system with three specialized bots (Lead, Seller, and Buyer) using a Q0-Q4 qualification framework. Implemented 3-tier Redis caching for 89% cost reduction on AI API calls. Integrated with GoHighLevel CRM for real-time lead sync and temperature tag publishing.

**Key Outcomes:**
- ✅ Lead response time reduced from 45min to 2min (95% improvement)
- ✅ $240,000 annual savings from reduced manual review time
- ✅ Conversion rate increased from 12% to 28% (133% improvement)
- ✅ 87% cache hit rate for repeated queries
- ✅ 92% accuracy in lead qualification framework
- ✅ 3x increase in agent productivity

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI, Claude API, PostgreSQL, Redis, Streamlit, GoHighLevel, Docker Compose
