## A4: Clawdbot/OpenClaw Configuration — $800 Fixed

```
Hi — following up on the OpenClaw configuration job. One thing I didn't mention in my proposal: I've built MCP server integrations in production (published mcp-server-toolkit on PyPI), which maps directly to wiring up OpenClaw's MCP-based tool connections for Claude and Gemini. If you're dealing with the openclaw.json model routing or getting Signal/Telegram webhooks to behave, I've debugged that exact pattern. Happy to hop on a quick call to scope what's blocking you — no prep needed on your end.

## A5: Python LLM Workflow Developer (C2H) — $65-75/hr

```
Hi — wanted to circle back on the Python LLM workflow developer role. Since submitting, I just finished benchmarking a 3-tier LLM caching layer that cut API costs 89% on a production agent system — the architecture doc is on my GitHub if you want to see the numbers. That kind of cost-conscious workflow engineering is what I'd bring to the contract-to-hire. If you're still evaluating candidates, I'm available for a 15-minute technical screen anytime this week.

## A6: Clawdbot Updates/Tuning Help — $500 Fixed

```
Hi — following up on the Clawdbot tuning job. Something I should have mentioned: I've worked extensively with prompt engineering and response pipeline tuning in production — including a 5-stage post-processing pipeline that handles language detection, compliance checks, and output formatting before the user ever sees a response. That same approach applies directly to tuning Clawdbot's system prompts and model routing for better output quality. Let me know if you'd like to walk through what you're seeing — I can usually diagnose tuning issues in a single call.

## A7: OpenClaw Tutor/Developer (3-step) — $60-90/hr

```
Hi — checking in on the OpenClaw tutor/developer role. Beyond what I shared in the proposal, I've been working with multi-agent orchestration systems where agents hand off context to each other with confidence scoring — that's essentially the pattern OpenClaw uses when routing between models and tools via MCP. If part of this role involves helping your team understand the architecture (not just configuring it), I've documented 33 Architecture Decision Records across my projects and enjoy making complex systems accessible. Would love to hear more about where you're at with the setup.
