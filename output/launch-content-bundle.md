## 1. Reddit r/forhire Post

**Title**: `[For Hire] AI/Python Engineer — Dashboards, RAG Systems, Chatbots ($50-$500)`

**Body**:

I'm an AI engineer with 11 production repositories, 8,500+ tests (all CI green), and a stack built around Python, FastAPI, LangChain, Streamlit, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker.

**What I build:**

- **CSV/Excel Dashboards** ($50-$200) — Upload your data, get an interactive Streamlit dashboard with filters, charts, and KPIs. Turnaround: 2-5 days.
- **RAG Document Q&A Systems** ($100-$500) — Ask questions against your PDFs, docs, or knowledge base. Production-grade retrieval with source citations. Includes hybrid search, reranking, and caching.
- **AI Chatbots** ($200-$500) — Custom conversational agents for lead qualification, customer support, or internal tools. Multi-model orchestration (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) with <200ms overhead.
- **Web Scraping Pipelines** ($100-$300) — Automated data collection with structured output, scheduling, and export to CSV/JSON/database.
- **Custom Python Automation** ($50-$300) — API integrations, data pipelines, ETL workflows, or anything else that needs code.

**Metrics from production systems:**

- 89% LLM cost reduction through intelligent caching
- 88% cache hit rate across L1/L2/L3 layers
- <200ms orchestration overhead
- 4.3M tool dispatches/sec throughput

## 2. LinkedIn Post (Gumroad Launch)

Just launched 4 developer tools on Gumroad — built from the same codebase that powers 11 production AI systems with 8,500+ passing tests.

Here's what's available:

**DocQA Engine** ($49) — Drop in your documents, get a production-ready RAG system with hybrid search, reranking, and source citations. Built on the same pipeline that handles enterprise document retrieval at 88% cache hit rates.

**AgentForge** ($39) — Multi-agent orchestration framework. Route between Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity with automatic fallback, token optimization, and structured output parsing. Powers systems doing 4.3M tool dispatches/sec.

**Scrape-and-Serve** ($29) — Web scraping pipeline with structured data extraction, scheduling, and API output. Connect it to any downstream system.

**Insight Engine** ($39) — Business intelligence toolkit. Feed it CSV/Excel data, get interactive dashboards with KPIs, trend analysis, and anomaly detection.

Every tool ships with tests, documentation, Docker support, and a working demo.

These aren't side projects — they're extracted from production systems that have been running in real deployments. The code is clean, typed, and CI-verified.

Need something custom? I also take on freelance projects — dashboards, RAG systems, chatbots, and automation. DM me or find me on Fiverr: https://www.fiverr.com/caymanroden

## 3. Twitter/X Thread (8 Tweets)

**Tweet 1:**
I built 11 production AI tools over the past year. 8,500+ tests. All CI green.

Now they're available as products and services.

Thread on what I built and how you can use it:

**Tweet 2:**
Tool #1: Enterprise RAG Pipeline

- Hybrid dense + sparse retrieval
- L1/L2/L3 caching (88% hit rate)
- 89% LLM cost reduction
- Reranking, source citations, query routing

This is what "production-ready" actually looks like.

**Tweet 3:**
Tool #2: Multi-Agent Orchestrator

- Routes between Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- 4.3M tool dispatches/sec
- <200ms overhead
- Automatic fallback + token optimization

One API call. Best model for the job. Every time.

**Tweet 4:**
Tool #3: Real Estate AI Platform

- 3 specialized chatbots (lead, buyer, seller)
- CRM integration (GoHighLevel)
- Temperature-based lead scoring
- Cross-bot handoff with conflict resolution

Full-stack AI for a real industry.

**Tweet 5:**
Tool #4: BI Dashboard System

- CSV/Excel to interactive dashboard in minutes
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Sentiment analysis + churn detection
- Streamlit-based, fully deployable

Data storytelling without the enterprise price tag.

**Tweet 6:**
I packaged the best parts into 4 Gumroad products:

- DocQA Engine ($49)
- AgentForge ($39)
- Scrape-and-Serve ($29)
- Insight Engine ($39)

Each ships with tests, docs, Docker, and a demo.

**Tweet 7:**
I'm also available for freelance work on Fiverr:

- CSV Dashboard: $50-$200
- RAG Q&A System: $100-$500
- AI Chatbot: $200-$500

Turnaround: 2-5 days. 8,500+ tests of proof that I ship quality.

## 4. Dev.to Article

**Title**: `Available for Hire: AI Engineer with 11 Production Repos and 8,500+ Tests`

**Tags**: `python, ai, machinelearning, hiring`

**Body**:

### About Me

I'm Cayman Roden, an AI engineer who builds production systems — not demos. Over the past year, I've shipped 11 repositories covering RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, BI dashboards, chatbot platforms, and web scraping infrastructure. Every repo has CI, typed code, and comprehensive test coverage (8,500+ tests total, all green).

My stack: Python, FastAPI, LangChain, Streamlit, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker.

### What I Build

Here are the numbers from production:

- **89% LLM cost reduction** through L1/L2/L3 intelligent caching
- **88% cache hit rate** across retrieval and orchestration layers
- **<200ms orchestration overhead** for multi-model AI routing
- **4.3M tool dispatches/sec** throughput in agent systems

I specialize in the gap between "it works in a notebook" and "it runs in production." That means proper error handling, caching, monitoring, rate limiting, and deployment infrastructure.
