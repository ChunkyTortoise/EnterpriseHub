## If No Jobs Match Today

1. Broaden budget filter to $100–$1,500
2. Remove "Last 24 hours" → Last 3 days
3. Try keyword variations (e.g., "automation script" instead of "python script")
4. Post a "Looking for work" profile update on Upwork — sometimes inbound finds you

---

## After First Win

1. Deliver 1 day EARLY
2. Over-communicate (1 status update mid-project)
3. Ask for review as part of final delivery message:
   > "Project complete! Files attached. One small ask — if the work met your expectations, a quick review on Upwork goes a long way for me as a new freelancer. No pressure either way. Thanks for the opportunity."
4. Offer $50 discount on next project to repeat buyers
