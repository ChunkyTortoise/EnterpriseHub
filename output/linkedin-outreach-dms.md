## 1. Startup CTO — Needs to Ship AI Features Fast

### Connection Request (< 300 chars)
```
Saw [company] is building [AI feature]. Shipping production AI is brutal — we cut LLM costs 89% with intelligent caching on a multi-model system. Happy to swap architecture notes if useful.
```

### Follow-up DM (24-48h after accepted, < 500 chars)
```
Thanks for connecting. Quick question — when [company] ships AI features, how much time goes into the gap between "works in a notebook" and "runs in production"?

That gap is all I work on. Built 11 production AI systems (RAG, multi-agent orchestration, chatbots) — each with CI, typed code, and sub-200ms overhead.

If you ever need an extra pair of hands to ship an AI feature without the 3-month ramp, I can do a free 30-min architecture review on whatever you're building. No pitch, just patterns.
```

### Second Follow-up (5-7 days, < 300 chars)
```
No worries if timing's off. Just shipped a multi-agent orchestrator handling 4.3M dispatches/sec — wrote up the architecture patterns. Want me to send it over? Might save your team a few weeks.
```

## 2. Agency Owner — Needs White-Label AI Services for Clients

### Connection Request (< 300 chars)
```
[Agency] does great work for [client type]. Curious — when clients ask for AI features, do you build in-house or sub out? I white-label AI systems for agencies (RAG, chatbots, dashboards). 11 production repos deep.
```

### Follow-up DM (24-48h after accepted, < 500 chars)
```
Thanks for connecting. Agencies I talk to hit the same wall: client wants AI, team doesn't have the bench for it, hiring a full-time ML engineer doesn't pencil out for one project.

That's where I plug in. I build white-label AI tools — dashboards, document Q&A, chatbots — under your brand. Turnaround is 2-10 days depending on scope. All 8,500+ tests, CI green, production-grade.

Would a free sample dashboard from a CSV you already have be useful? Takes me a day, gives you something to show clients.
```

### Second Follow-up (5-7 days, < 300 chars)
```
One more thought — just finished a chatbot system with cross-bot handoff and lead scoring for a real estate client. The architecture works for any industry. Want the case study?
```

## 3. SaaS Founder — Needs AI Integration Into Existing Product

### Connection Request (< 300 chars)
```
[Product] looks solid. Adding AI features to an existing SaaS is tricky — you need it fast but can't break what works. Built 11 production AI integrations with <200ms overhead. Happy to trade notes.
```

### Follow-up DM (24-48h after accepted, < 500 chars)
```
Thanks for connecting. The hardest part of adding AI to a SaaS product isn't the model — it's the integration. Caching, fallback chains, error handling, latency budgets. Miss any of those and users notice.

I specialize in exactly that layer. My orchestration systems run at 88% cache hit rates, meaning most AI calls resolve from cache instead of burning tokens. Users get instant responses. You save on API costs.

Want me to do a free 15-min audit of where AI could plug into [product]? I'll map out the integration points and give you a realistic scope estimate.
```

### Second Follow-up (5-7 days, < 300 chars)
```
Figured this might be relevant — wrote up how we cut LLM costs 89% through L1/L2/L3 caching in a production system. Happy to send the breakdown if you're exploring AI pricing models.
```

## 4. Data Team Lead — Needs Dashboards and Automation

### Connection Request (< 300 chars)
```
[Company]'s data team is doing interesting work. Building dashboards from raw data shouldn't take weeks — I turn CSV/Excel into interactive Streamlit dashboards in 2-3 days. 8,500+ tests across the toolkit.
```

### Follow-up DM (24-48h after accepted, < 500 chars)
```
Thanks for connecting. Quick question — how much of your team's time goes to building one-off dashboards and reports vs. actual analysis?

I built a BI toolkit that generates interactive dashboards with KPIs, trend analysis, and anomaly detection from CSV/Excel files. Monte Carlo simulations, churn detection, sentiment analysis — all baked in.

Instead of pitching, here's an offer: send me any CSV your team already has. I'll build a working Streamlit dashboard for free in 48 hours. If it's useful, we talk. If not, you keep it anyway.
```

### Second Follow-up (5-7 days, < 300 chars)
```
Just shipped an anomaly detection pipeline that flags outliers automatically — no manual threshold tuning. If your team deals with noisy data, I can show you how it works in under 15 min.
```

## 5. Marketing Director — Needs Lead Scoring / Chatbot

### Connection Request (< 300 chars)
```
[Company]'s marketing is sharp. Curious — are you scoring leads automatically or still relying on manual qualification? Built a system that tags Hot/Warm/Cold leads in real-time with 89% cost efficiency.
```

### Follow-up DM (24-48h after accepted, < 500 chars)
```
Thanks for connecting. Here's what I see with most marketing teams: leads come in, someone manually reviews them, and by the time a hot lead gets routed, it's 4 hours old. Conversion drops off a cliff.

I built an AI lead scoring system that classifies leads into Hot/Warm/Cold in real-time, triggers CRM workflows automatically, and routes high-intent leads to agents within minutes. It runs on <200ms latency.

Want a free audit of your current lead flow? I'll map the bottlenecks and show you where automation would have the biggest impact. Takes 15 minutes on a call.
```

### Second Follow-up (5-7 days, < 300 chars)
```
Quick thought — also built AI chatbots that qualify leads conversationally before passing to sales. One system handles 3 specialized bots with automatic handoff. Want the architecture overview?
```

---

## 6. Real Estate Broker — Needs CRM Automation + Chatbot

### Connection Request (< 300 chars)
```
Running a brokerage in [market] is a lead management marathon. Built AI chatbots and CRM automation specifically for real estate — GoHighLevel integrated, lead scoring, automated follow-ups. 11 systems deep.
```

### Follow-up DM (24-48h after accepted, < 500 chars)
```
Thanks for connecting. Real estate question — how many leads does your team touch before they go cold? Most brokerages I talk to lose 30-40% of leads to slow follow-up.

I built an AI system for a Rancho Cucamonga brokerage that does 3 things automatically: qualifies leads via chatbot, scores them Hot/Warm/Cold, and triggers GHL workflows based on temperature. Buyer bot, seller bot, lead bot — all handing off to each other seamlessly.

Want me to set up a free 15-min walkthrough of how it works? I'll show the actual CRM integration, no slides.
```

### Second Follow-up (5-7 days, < 300 chars)
```
One data point: the system tags leads as Hot/Warm/Cold within seconds and triggers agent notifications automatically. If slow lead response is costing your team deals, worth a quick look.
```

## 7. Healthcare Admin — Needs Document Processing / Compliance

### Connection Request (< 300 chars)
```
Healthcare document processing under HIPAA constraints is a different game. Built production RAG systems that handle document retrieval with full audit trails and 88% cache hit rate. Happy to share patterns.
```

### Follow-up DM (24-48h after accepted, < 500 chars)
```
Thanks for connecting. Quick question — how is [organization] handling document search and retrieval across patient records, clinical notes, or compliance docs?

Most healthcare orgs I talk to either rely on manual search (slow) or generic AI tools that don't meet compliance requirements (risky).

I built production RAG pipelines that retrieve documents with source citations, audit trails, and configurable access controls. The system runs at 88% cache hit rate — fast enough for clinical workflows.

Would a 15-min walkthrough of the architecture be useful? I can show how it handles compliance without sacrificing speed.
```

### Second Follow-up (5-7 days, < 300 chars)
```
Forgot to mention — the system also handles structured data extraction from medical documents. If [organization] is manually pulling data from PDFs, there's a faster path. Want details?
```

## 8. Legal Tech Firm — Needs Document Search / RAG

### Connection Request (< 300 chars)
```
Legal document search needs precision most AI tools can't deliver. Built a RAG pipeline with hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse), source citations, and reranking — 89% cost reduction at scale. Worth comparing notes?
```

### Follow-up DM (24-48h after accepted, < 500 chars)
```
Thanks for connecting. Here's the problem I keep hearing from legal tech teams: generic RAG works for simple queries but falls apart on multi-document reasoning, citation accuracy, and jurisdiction-specific retrieval.

I built a production RAG system with hybrid dense + sparse retrieval, reranking, and citation scoring. It handles cross-document queries with source grounding — the kind of accuracy legal workflows require.

The system runs at <200ms latency with L1/L2/L3 caching. Want me to do a free technical audit of your current retrieval pipeline? I'll flag the precision gaps and suggest fixes. 15 minutes, no strings.
```

### Second Follow-up (5-7 days, < 300 chars)
```
Just finished a document Q&A system that handles 3 retrieval strategies simultaneously and picks the best results via reranking. If citation accuracy matters for your product, happy to walk through it.
```

## 9. E-commerce Manager — Needs Scraping / Price Monitoring

### Connection Request (< 300 chars)
```
Tracking competitor pricing manually doesn't scale. Built automated scraping pipelines with structured data extraction, scheduling, and real-time alerts — handles price monitoring across 100+ SKUs. Worth a look?
```

### Follow-up DM (24-48h after accepted, < 500 chars)
```
Thanks for connecting. Quick question — how is [company] tracking competitor pricing right now? Manual spot checks, or something automated?

Companies using automated repricing see 8-15% margin improvements because they catch price changes in hours, not days.

I build scraping pipelines that monitor competitor sites on a schedule, extract structured price data, and push alerts when prices change. Output goes to CSV, JSON, or directly into your systems via API.

Want me to set up a free proof-of-concept? Pick 3 competitor product pages — I'll build the scraper and show you live data in 48 hours. You keep it either way.
```

### Second Follow-up (5-7 days, < 300 chars)
```
Another angle — also build dashboards that visualize price trends over time across your competitive landscape. If you're making repricing decisions from spreadsheets, this might help. Want a sample?
```

## 10. Fintech PM — Needs Data Pipeline / Analytics

### Connection Request (< 300 chars)
```
Financial data pipelines need reliability that most prototypes can't deliver. Built 11 production systems with 8,500+ tests, all CI green — specializing in ETL, analytics, and forecasting. Happy to trade patterns.
```

### Follow-up DM (24-48h after accepted, < 500 chars)
```
Thanks for connecting. Fintech data question — what's the bottleneck in your analytics pipeline right now? Ingestion, transformation, or getting insights to stakeholders fast enough?

I build production data pipelines that handle ETL, anomaly detection, and forecasting. One system I built does Monte Carlo simulations and predictive analytics with automated alerting — configurable rules, cooldown periods, SLA compliance tracking.

Rather than a sales call, want me to do a free pipeline audit? Walk me through your current architecture in 15 minutes, and I'll send back a write-up of where you're losing time and what to fix. No cost.
```

### Second Follow-up (5-7 days, < 300 chars)
```
Relevant data point: built a caching layer that handles 88% hit rate on repeated analytical queries — P50/P95/P99 latency tracking included. If your dashboards are slow, the fix might be simpler than you think.
```
