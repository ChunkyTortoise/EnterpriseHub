## 💎 ELITE PHASE UPGRADE (NEW)

Your system has been upgraded with **Elite Phase** capabilities. These features can be activated via the sidebar toggle in your dashboard.

### 🧠 **1. Graphiti Semantic Memory (The "Brain")**
- **Standard:** AI remembers only the current chat session.
- **Elite:** AI builds a permanent **Knowledge Graph** of every lead. It remembers that "Sarah hates HOAs" across multiple weeks and sessions, providing "Architectural Recall" in your sidebar.

### ⚖️ **2. Strategy-Based Property Matcher**
- **Standard:** Simple budget and bedroom filtering.
- **Elite:** **AI Semantic Search** mode. The AI reads property descriptions and matching them to lead lifestyle factors (e.g., "gigabit fiber", "natural light", "investment yield") instead of just hard numbers.

### 🎯 **3. Dynamic Scoring Weights**
- **Standard:** Static lead scoring.
- **Elite:** **Adaptive Scoring**. The system automatically adjusts weights based on the **Market Condition** (e.g., scoring urgency higher in a Seller's Market) and **Lead Segment** (investors vs. first-time buyers).

### 🌲 **4. Advanced Decision Logic**
- **Standard:** Linear automations.
- **Elite:** **Intelligent Routing**. Uses complex decision trees to determine if a lead should go to a "Direct Call Bridge" (Hot) or a "Nurture Sequence" (Warm) based on real-time behavior.
