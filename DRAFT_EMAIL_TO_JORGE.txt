Subject: Urgent: Project Status Update and Rescheduling - [Project Name]

Hi Jorge,

I am writing to sincerely apologize, but I need to request that we reschedule our interview and demo session.

Currently, the front-end dashboards and visual components are experiencing technical errors that I have not been able to resolve in time for our scheduled meeting. I feel terrible about this delay, especially given our previous rescheduling. 

As a gesture of goodwill and to acknowledge the inconvenience this has caused you, I would like to deduct $100 from the project total.

I am confident that I can have these issues fully resolved within the next 3–4 hours. I have a brief appointment tomorrow midday, but I will be completely ready to present the finalized, functional dashboards anytime after 2:00 PM tomorrow.

Thank you for your continued patience and understanding. I am committed to ensuring the final product meets the high standards we’ve discussed.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
