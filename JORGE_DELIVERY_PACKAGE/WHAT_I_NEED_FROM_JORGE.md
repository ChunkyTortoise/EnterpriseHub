## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

### Phase 1 (This Week): USE WHAT WE HAVE ✅
- Current setup is fully functional
- Let Jorge test and see results
- No additional info needed

### Phase 2 (Next Week): EXPAND IF NEEDED
**Only ask for these IF Jorge:**
- Wants cloud deployment → Railway account
- Wants more sub-accounts → Location IDs + API keys
- Wants agency-wide → New agency API key
- Wants calendar booking → Calendar ID

---

## ✉️ WHAT TO INCLUDE IN EMAIL

### Keep It Simple:
```
Current Setup: ✅ Working perfectly for Lyrio account

Optional Upgrades (when you're ready):
• Cloud deployment: Need Railway account (10 min)
• More sub-accounts: Send Location IDs + API keys (2 min each)
• Agency-wide access: Need new agency API key (3 min)
• Calendar booking: Send Calendar ID (1 min)

Start using what you have now. We'll upgrade later if needed.
```

## 🚫 DON'T NEED

- ❌ Lyrio login credentials (have API already)
- ❌ GHL master password (not needed)
- ❌ Railway credentials yet (only if deploying)
- ❌ Domain/hosting (Railway provides it)
- ❌ Credit card info (system uses his existing accounts)

---

## 📧 SUMMARY FOR EMAIL

**Later (optional):**
- Railway account (for cloud deployment)
- More Location IDs (for more sub-accounts)
- New agency API key (for all sub-accounts at once)

**Let Jorge use the system first, then decide what he wants to add.**
