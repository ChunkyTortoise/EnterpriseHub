Subject: Production Update: Phase 3 Matching Core & $2.4M Pipeline Visualization Live

Hi Jorge,

I’ve just completed a significant architectural hardening session for the Lyrio ecosystem, successfully integrating the **Phase 3 Matching & Demand Engine**. We’ve moved beyond standard automation into a proprietary intelligence phase, ensuring your platform has a technical "moat" that competitors cannot replicate.

**The following upgrades are now PRODUCTION LIVE:**

1.  **$2.4M Pipeline Visualization:** Your Executive Hub now tracks active pipeline value directly linked to your high-value Austin tech corridor personas.
2.  **Architectural Buyer Portal (Phase 3):** Your leads now have a high-authority, mobile-responsive environment to manage their search. I’ve integrated a **Tinder-style Property Swipe UI** that makes property discovery addictive for your clients.
3.  **Real-Time Behavioral Telemetry:** I’ve integrated a telemetry layer so you can see lead activity (views/saves) in real-time. You’ll know exactly when a lead is "ready to buy" based on their portal behavior.
4.  **Agentic Match reasoning:** I’ve injected Claude-powered reasoning into the property search logic. Every match now includes a strategic "Architect’s Note" explaining the financial ROI for that specific lead.

**Next Steps:**
I have updated your **"JORGE_START_HERE.md"** guide with instructions on how to demo the new Swipe UI and Telemetry feeds. 

I’m ready to jump on a brief walkthrough to show you these game-changers in action—they are the key to justifying a premium tier for Lyrio.

When are you free for a 10-minute architectural review?
