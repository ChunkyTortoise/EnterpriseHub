Subject: Production Update: Architectural Hardening & Intelligence Core Live

Hi Jorge,

I’ve just completed a significant architectural hardening session for the Lyrio ecosystem. We’ve moved beyond standard automation into a proprietary intelligence phase, ensuring your platform has a technical "moat" that competitors cannot replicate.

**The following upgrades are now PRODUCTION LIVE:**

1.  **Behavioral Prediction Engine:** Your dashboard now features real-time conversion forecasting. We aren't just "scoring" leads anymore; we are predicting the probability of a close based on engagement velocity and sentiment.
2.  **Agentic Property Matcher:** I’ve injected Claude-powered reasoning into the property search logic. Every match now includes a strategic "Architect’s Note" explaining the financial and lifestyle ROI for that specific lead.
3.  **Branded Architectural Portal:** Your leads now have a high-authority, mobile-responsive environment to manage their search. I’ve integrated a telemetry layer so you can see their activity (views/saves) in real-time on your command center.
4.  **Sentiment-Aware Recovery:** Our re-engagement logic is now context-aware. If a lead goes silent, the AI analyzes their previous history to craft a personalized "Value Hook" instead of a generic template.

**Next Steps:**
I have attached the **Strategic Scalability Proposal (Phase 2 & 3)**. These upgrades have prepared the foundation for our next stage: the **Full Conversion Engine**.

I’m ready to jump on a brief walkthrough to show you the "Predictions" and "Telemetry" feeds in action—they are game-changers for justifying a premium tier for Lyrio.

When are you free for a 10-minute architectural review?
