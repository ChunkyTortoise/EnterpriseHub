# Welcome to the GHL Real Estate AI Project

**For: Jorge**
**Date: January 5, 2026**

This repository has been forensically audited and optimized for production deployment. This document serves as your "White Glove" entry point.

## 📂 The "Golden Root" Structure

We have cleaned up 50+ development artifacts to leave you with a pristine, production-ready codebase.

### 🚀 Core Application
- **`app.py`**: The main entry point for the Streamlit application. Run this to start the dashboard.
- **`ghl_real_estate_ai/`**: The heart of the system. Contains all business logic, agents, and data processing modules.
- **`demo_app.py`**: A simplified public-facing demo version (Market Pulse module).

### 📚 Documentation (`docs/`)
We consolidated technical guides into the `docs/` folder:
- **`DEPLOYMENT.md`**: How to deploy to Railway/Streamlit Cloud.
- **`MONITORING_SETUP_GUIDE.md`**: Setting up alerts and health checks.
- **`INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAYBOOK.md`**: What to do if something goes wrong.

### 🗄️ Archives (`_archive/`)
Historical context is preserved but tucked away:
- **`_archive/sessions/`**: Daily handoff logs from the development phase.
- **`_archive/strategy/`**: Original business planning and Go-To-Market docs.
- **`_archive/deliveries/`**: Past milestone deliveries.
