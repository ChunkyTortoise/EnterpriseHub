## ROI Calculation Framework

### Investment vs Return Analysis
```python
# Portfolio Project ROI Calculator
def calculate_portfolio_roi(
    development_time_hours: int,
    hourly_rate: float,
    project_value_increase: float,
    projects_per_year: int,
    portfolio_lifespan_years: int = 2
):
    """
    Calculate portfolio project return on investment
    """
    initial_investment = development_time_hours * hourly_rate
    annual_revenue_increase = project_value_increase * projects_per_year
    total_revenue_increase = annual_revenue_increase * portfolio_lifespan_years

    roi_percentage = ((total_revenue_increase - initial_investment) / initial_investment) * 100
    payback_period = initial_investment / annual_revenue_increase

    return {
        'roi_percentage': roi_percentage,
        'payback_period_years': payback_period,
        'total_return': total_revenue_increase,
        'net_profit': total_revenue_increase - initial_investment
    }

# Example: $20k development investment, $50k avg project increase, 4 projects/year
# ROI: 900% over 2 years, 6-month payback period
