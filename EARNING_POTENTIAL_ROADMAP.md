- **Content Engine Prompt Library**: $19 (100 proven prompts)
- **Financial Modeling Course**: $99 (6-week email course)
- **Projection**: 20 sales/month × $29 avg = **$580/month** = $6,960/year

**Strategy C: Consulting/Freelance**
- Offer "Enterprise Hub customization" on Upwork/Toptal
- **Rates**: $75-$150/hour for custom dashboards, integrations

- Showcase Content Engine as flagship AI work
- Build 2-3 more AI tools (image generation, code review bot, research assistant)
- Get active in AI communities (r/LocalLLaMA, HuggingFace forums)

### 6. Upgrade Your Job Search Strategy (+$10k-$30k)

**Apply to Higher-Paying Companies**
- **Current Target**: Generic "Python Developer" at $85k-$120k
- **New Target**: Specific companies known for high comp:
  - **FinTech**: Stripe ($140k-$180k), Plaid ($130k-$170k), Robinhood ($150k-$200k)

  > "I built this [live demo link] — it's gotten 1,000+ users in a month. I'd love to bring this execution to [Company]'s [specific product]."
- **Why**: Shows rather than tells, memorable, demonstrates initiative

**Target Roles 1-2 Levels Above Your Experience**
- If entry-level → apply for mid-level ($20k-$30k higher)
- If mid-level → apply for senior ($30k-$50k higher)
- **Why**: Enterprise Hub is a senior-level portfolio piece; don't undersell yourself

---

### 7. Negotiate Aggressively (+$10k-$25k)

**Always Negotiate (Even If You Like the Offer)**
```
Scenario: Offer is $100k
You: "I really appreciate the offer. Based on my Enterprise Hub project
(7 production modules, 1,000+ users, AI integration), I was expecting
closer to $120k. Is there flexibility here?"

Result: Even if they only move to $110k, that's $10k/year = $40k over 4 years
```

**Ask for Sign-On Bonus**
- If they can't budge on salary, ask for $10k-$20k sign-on
- **Script**: "If $120k isn't possible, could we bridge the gap with a sign-on bonus?"

**Negotiate Equity**
- Early-stage startups: Ask for 0.10%-0.50% equity (mid-level)
- Could be worth $50k-$500k+ at exit
