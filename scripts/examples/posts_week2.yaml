      Just shipped a multi-agent orchestration system that reduced client acquisition costs by 40%.

      Key learnings:
      • Agent coordination beats single LLMs for complex workflows
      • Prompt caching = 10x cost reduction
      • Context management is the hardest problem

      Tech stack: Claude + Gemini + Redis + FastAPI
      Results: <200ms overhead, 94% test coverage

      Real estate is being transformed by AI. Here are 3 trends I'm seeing:

      1. **Conversational CRM**: AI chatbots qualifying leads 24/7
         - 80% qualification accuracy
         - 3x response rate vs. traditional forms

      2. **Predictive Analytics**: ML scoring lead quality
         - Financial readiness detection
         - Intent classification at 90%+ accuracy

      3. **Automated Workflows**: End-to-end lifecycle automation
         - From lead capture → follow-up → transaction tracking
         - 60% time savings for agents

      Tech stack matters: GoHighLevel + Claude + Redis + Streamlit

      How do you ship AI features with confidence?

      I just crossed 322 tests (94% coverage) across 11 repos. Here's my approach:

      **Testing Strategy:**
      • Unit tests: Core logic, edge cases
      • Integration tests: API contracts, DB queries
      • E2E tests: Full user workflows
      • Load tests: Scale to 100 concurrent users

      **Key Insights:**
      • Mocking LLM calls = deterministic tests
      • Pytest fixtures = DRY test code
      • GitHub Actions = CI on every PR

      **Results:**
      • Zero production bugs in 3 months
      • Deploy with confidence
      • Faster feature development

      What's your testing philosophy for AI systems?
