## AGENT TEAM STRUCTURE

When executing with a team, organize agents as:

### Team: `freelance-growth`

| Agent Name | Type | Workstreams | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `platform-researcher` | general-purpose | WS1.1, WS1.2, WS1.3, WS1.4 | Research platform requirements, prepare application profiles |
| `asset-builder` | general-purpose | WS2.1, WS2.2, WS2.3, WS2.5 | Create audit templates, case studies, service packages, site updates |
| `content-strategist` | general-purpose | WS3.1, WS3.2, WS3.3, WS3.4, WS2.4 | Community plans, content calendars, outreach templates, monitoring |
| `deployment-ops` | general-purpose | WS4.1, WS4.3, WS4.4, WS4.5 | Deploy Streamlit apps, publish PyPI, verify Gumroad content |
| `rate-analyst` | general-purpose | WS5.1 | Rate justification, competitive analysis, positioning |

### Dependencies Between Agents:
- `asset-builder` (WS2.1 audit template) → blocks → `content-strategist` (WS2.4 outreach enhancement)
- `asset-builder` (WS2.3 case study) → blocks → `content-strategist` (WS2.4 outreach, WS3.1 GHL content)
- `deployment-ops` (WS4.3 Streamlit) → blocks → cold outreach (needs live demo URLs)
- `rate-analyst` (WS5.1) → informs → all platform applications and outreach

### Parallelization:
- `platform-researcher` + `rate-analyst` + `deployment-ops` can all start immediately
- `asset-builder` can start WS2.1 and WS2.3 immediately (no deps)
- `content-strategist` starts WS3.1 (community research) and WS3.4 (monitoring) immediately, waits for WS2.1/WS2.3 before WS2.4
