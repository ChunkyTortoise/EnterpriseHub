## Application Strategy Notes

### Priority Tiers

**Tier 1 -- Apply This Week (strongest alignment + remote):**
1. **Prompt Health** (both roles) -- Remote US, $160K--$220K, exact stack match
2. **Concourse** -- FastAPI + PostgreSQL + multi-LLM, YC-backed, strong comp
3. **Rula Staff AI Engineer** -- Remote, RAG + multi-agent orchestration, healthcare domain

**Tier 2 -- Apply Within 2 Weeks:**
4. **Cresta FDE** -- Remote, AI agents + RAG, lower comp but great experience
5. **Goodfin** -- Agentic AI, YC, strong skill match
6. **Confido** -- Full AI/ML lifecycle, YC, PostgreSQL stack
7. **Salesforce FDE** -- Enterprise brand, remote options, AI agents

**Tier 3 -- Worth the Shot:**
8. **Starbridge** -- Premium comp ($200K--$380K) but NYC onsite
9. **Palantir** -- Prestigious, strong career signal, competitive process
10. **Spherecast** -- End-to-end LLM systems, YC, founding role

### Cover Letter Emphasis Points

These themes recur across nearly every listing and should be front-and-center:

1. **Production LLM orchestration**: The Claude orchestrator with L1/L2/L3 caching and <200ms overhead is a standout differentiator. Most candidates talk about using LLMs; few have built orchestration layers with measurable latency targets.

2. **Multi-agent systems**: The Jorge bot ecosystem (lead/buyer/seller bots with handoff service, confidence thresholds, circular prevention, rate limiting) is exactly what companies like Concourse, Rula, and Prompt Health are building. Lead with this.

3. **RAG pipelines**: The advanced RAG system with embeddings and vector store shows practical retrieval experience. Mention chunk strategies, embedding approaches, and retrieval accuracy metrics.

4. **89% token cost reduction**: This is a headline number. Every company building on LLMs cares about cost optimization. Reference the cost-token-optimization work specifically.

5. **Automated testing at scale**: 750+ tests across 7 repos with all CI green demonstrates production engineering discipline that most AI engineers lack. This separates "prototype builder" from "production engineer."

6. **Full-stack ownership**: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis + Streamlit + Docker + GitHub Actions shows you can own the entire stack, not just the AI layer.

### Companies Specifically Seeking Multi-Agent / RAG / Chatbot Experience

These listings explicitly mention the candidate's core differentiators:

| Company | Explicitly Mentions |
|---------|-------------------|
| Concourse | Multi-step agent workflows, tool orchestration, LLM APIs (Anthropic, Claude) |
| Rula | Multi-agent orchestration, RAG pipelines, evaluation frameworks |
| Prompt Health | End-to-end AI systems, evaluation, monitoring, guardrails |
| Cresta | AI agent frameworks, function calling, RAG |
| EY | Multi-agent systems, RAG architectures, agent orchestration |
| Goodfin | Agentic AI, multi-step planning, tool orchestration |
| Starbridge | Document analysis, interactive chat, RAG implementation |
| Spherecast | Multi-step agent workflows, LLM observability, evaluation pipelines |
| Deepset | RAG/agent systems (they built Haystack) |

### Common Requirements to Address

| Requirement | How to Address |
|-------------|---------------|
| Cloud platforms (AWS/GCP) | Mention Docker Compose deployment, GitHub Actions CI/CD, container-first architecture |
| ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow) | Be transparent -- strength is in LLM application engineering, not model training. Position as complementary |
| Agent frameworks (LangChain) | Custom orchestration layer is arguably more impressive than using LangChain. Frame as "built equivalent from scratch" |
| Evaluation pipelines | Reference the A/B testing service, performance tracker (P50/P95/P99), and alerting service as production eval infrastructure |
| Team leadership | 17 domain-agnostic agents, 7 repos, open-source portfolio demonstrates technical leadership |

### Salary Expectations

Based on current market data for remote AI/LLM engineers in the US (February 2026):
- **Mid-level (3--5 years):** $140,000 -- $180,000
- **Senior (5--8 years):** $170,000 -- $220,000
- **Staff (8+ years):** $200,000 -- $280,000
- **Founding/startup equity roles:** $110,000 -- $180,000 base + 0.1%--1.5% equity
