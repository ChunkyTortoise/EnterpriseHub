### Professional Headline
**AI Engineer | LLM Orchestration | RAG Pipelines**

### Profile Overview (650 words)

I'm an AI Engineer who builds production-ready systems that businesses can actually deploy and scale. My specialty is taking complex LLM concepts and turning them into reliable, tested, documented solutions that work in the real world.

**What I Deliver**

When you hire me, you get systems with 80%+ test coverage, comprehensive documentation, and CI/CD pipelines that ensure quality. I don't just write code — I ship complete solutions.

My approach focuses on three pillars:
1. **Production-grade quality**: Every system I build includes automated tests, error handling, monitoring, and deployment automation
2. **Business impact**: I optimize for metrics that matter — response time, cost efficiency, conversion rates, user satisfaction
3. **Knowledge transfer**: Clear documentation, architecture diagrams, and training materials so your team can maintain the system

**Proven Track Record**

I've built and deployed 11 open-source repositories with 7,016 automated tests, all with passing CI pipelines. These aren't toy projects — they're production-ready systems that demonstrate real-world problem-solving:

### Professional Summary (380 words)

I'm an AI Engineer who specializes in building enterprise-grade LLM orchestration systems, multi-agent architectures, and RAG pipelines that deliver measurable business impact. My work combines deep technical expertise with a focus on production reliability, cost optimization, and scalable deployment.

Over the past year, I've built 11 open-source repositories with 7,016 automated tests — all maintaining green CI pipelines. These aren't academic exercises; they're production-ready systems that demonstrate enterprise-level engineering practices: comprehensive testing, security hardening, performance optimization, and complete documentation.

**Enterprise-Grade Engineering**

My approach to AI systems engineering prioritizes the concerns that matter to enterprise clients:

**Reliability**: Every system I build includes 80%+ test coverage, structured error handling, monitoring, and alerting. The EnterpriseHub platform runs 4,937 automated tests on every commit, ensuring zero-regression deployments.

**Performance**: I've optimized systems to handle 10 requests/second with <200ms latency, implemented 3-tier Redis caching strategies that reduced database load by 90%, and achieved 89% LLM cost reduction through intelligent prompt optimization and caching.

**Security**: All implementations follow security best practices — encrypted PII at rest, environment-based secrets management, JWT authentication, input validation with Pydantic, and compliance with industry regulations (CCPA, CAN-SPAM, Fair Housing).

**Scalability**: I design systems for growth — async FastAPI architectures, connection pooling, rate limiting, circuit breakers, and horizontal scaling capabilities.

**Key Technical Achievements**

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Built a real estate chatbot platform with three specialized agents (lead qualification, buyer, seller) featuring intelligent handoff logic, circular prevention, rate limiting, and pattern learning from outcomes. Achieves 0.7+ confidence thresholds with real-time CRM synchronization.

- **RAG Pipeline Engineering**: Developed hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 + TF-IDF that processes 1,000+ page documents in under 2 seconds with citation scoring and relevance ranking.

- **Cost Optimization**: Implemented 3-tier caching strategy (L1: in-memory, L2: Redis, L3: PostgreSQL) that reduced API costs by 89% while maintaining <200ms response times.

- **Production Infrastructure**: Deployed systems with Docker containerization, GitHub Actions CI/CD, database migrations with Alembic, and comprehensive monitoring/alerting.

Enterprise clients choose me because I deliver complete, production-ready solutions — not prototypes. You get tested code, security hardening, deployment automation, documentation, and knowledge transfer.

## 4. Contra Profile

### Creative Headline
**AI Engineer Who Builds Systems That Actually Ship**

### About Section (350 words)

Most AI engineers can build a chatbot. I build chatbots that handle 10,000 conversations, integrate with your CRM, track performance metrics, and cost 89% less to run.

The difference? I'm obsessed with production reliability.

**My Story**

After 20+ years in software engineering, I found my sweet spot: taking cutting-edge AI research and turning it into boring, reliable systems that businesses can actually use. No hype, no vaporware — just tested code that solves real problems.

Over the past year, I've built 11 open-source repositories with 7,016 automated tests. Each one represents a different problem I've solved: RAG document search, multi-agent orchestration, cost optimization, data analytics, web scraping.

They're all on GitHub. They all have green CI pipelines. They all have live demos you can try right now.

**What Makes Me Different**

I don't just deliver code — I deliver complete solutions:

- **Tests**: 80%+ coverage on everything I ship
- **Documentation**: Architecture diagrams, API references, runbooks
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines, health checks
- **Monitoring**: Logging, alerting, performance tracking
- **Training**: Knowledge transfer so your team can maintain it

When I finish a project, you can deploy it to production tomorrow. Not "eventually, after we fix a bunch of stuff" — tomorrow.

**Why Clients Hire Me**

Because I make AI engineering boring in the best way. You want:
- Chatbots that don't hallucinate and break? I build validation layers and fallback chains.
- RAG systems that actually cite sources? I implement citation scoring and relevance ranking.
- LLM costs bleeding your budget? I optimize with 3-tier caching and prompt engineering.
- Multi-agent systems that don't create chaos? I build handoff logic with circular prevention and conflict resolution.

I solve the unsexy problems that separate prototypes from production systems.

**Let's Work Together**

Whether you need a complete AI platform or help fixing an existing system, I bring the same obsessive attention to reliability. Check out my service tiers below or let's talk about a custom solution.

Based in Palm Springs, work fully remote, async-first communication.
