## 1. Headline

```
AI Engineer | LLMOps & RAG Systems | Python, LangChain, FastAPI | Multi-Agent Orchestration
```

**Why this one**: Front-loaded keywords visible on mobile (~55 chars before truncation), Boolean-searchable by recruiters, no vanity metrics. The other 3 options from the spec either dropped a key term (LangChain, RAG) or led with a less searchable phrase.

## 8. Five LinkedIn Posts (Ready to Publish)

### Post 1: Introduction

```
I've spent the last 2 years building AI systems that actually run in production.

Not Jupyter notebooks. Not proof-of-concepts. Real software with CI pipelines, test suites, and monitoring.

Here's what that looks like:

-- 91+ API routes on an async FastAPI backend
-- 3 AI chatbots that hand off conversations to each other automatically
-- A caching system that cut our LLM token costs by 89%
-- 11 CI/CD workflows that run on every push

The gap between "I can call the OpenAI API" and "I can build a production AI system" is enormous. It's the difference between writing a script and building software.

I'm going to start sharing what I've learned about making that jump -- the architecture decisions, the cost optimization tricks, the testing strategies that actually work for non-deterministic systems.

If you're building with LLMs in production, let's connect. I'd love to hear what problems you're running into.

#AIEngineering #LLMOps #Python #BuildInPublic #SoftwareEngineering
```

### Post 2: Technical Insight (Token Cost Reduction)

```
We cut our LLM token costs by 89%.

93K tokens per workflow down to 7.8K.

No model downgrade. No quality loss. Here's the framework:

1. Context windowing
Stop sending the full conversation history every call. We built a sliding window that keeps only the last N relevant turns plus a compressed summary of everything before. Immediate 40% reduction.

2. Multi-tier caching
L1: In-memory cache for identical prompts (hits in <1ms)
L2: Redis for semantically similar queries (hits in <5ms)
L3: Database for long-tail patterns

Cache hit rate after 2 weeks: 67%.

3. Prompt compression
Rewrote system prompts to be instruction-dense. Removed examples that the model didn't need after the first few interactions. Cut system prompt tokens by 60%.

The math: if you're spending $500/month on API calls, this framework saves you $445.

Most teams I talk to are still sending full context on every call. That's the lowest-hanging fruit in LLMOps.

What's your biggest LLM cost problem?

```

### Post 3: Project Showcase (Multi-Agent Handoff)

```
I built a system where 3 AI chatbots hand off conversations to each other in real time.

Here's how it works and why it was harder than expected.

The setup:
-- Lead Bot: qualifies new contacts (budget, timeline, intent)
-- Buyer Bot: matches properties to preferences
-- Seller Bot: handles pricing, CMAs, and listing strategy

The problem: a lead bot conversation often reveals the person is actually a seller. You need to transfer context seamlessly without the person repeating themselves.

The handoff system:
1. Confidence scoring -- each bot continuously evaluates whether the conversation belongs to a different bot (threshold: 0.7)
2. Context packaging -- conversation history, extracted entities, and qualification scores get bundled into a handoff payload
3. Circular prevention -- if Bot A handed to Bot B, Bot B can't hand back to Bot A within 30 minutes
4. Rate limiting -- max 3 handoffs per hour, 10 per day per contact (prevents infinite loops)

The hardest bug: two bots simultaneously deciding the contact belonged to the other. Solution: contact-level locking with conflict resolution.

Production result: handoff success rate above 90%, zero infinite loops.

Multi-agent systems aren't hard because of the AI. They're hard because of the coordination.

### Post 4: Hot Take

```
Hot take: RAG is going to matter more in 2026, not less.

I keep seeing "RAG is dead, just use longer context windows" takes. Here's why that's wrong:

1. Cost scales linearly with context length
Stuffing 100K tokens into every call because "the model can handle it" works for demos. In production at scale, that's burning money. RAG lets you retrieve only the 2-3 relevant chunks.

2. Retrieval quality is controllable
With RAG, you can measure precision and recall. You can A/B test retrieval strategies. You can tune BM25 weights vs. dense embeddings. A giant context window is a black box.

3. Freshness is non-negotiable for most use cases
Your 200K context model was trained months ago. Your RAG index was updated 5 minutes ago. For anything time-sensitive -- pricing, inventory, market data -- retrieval wins.

4. Hybrid retrieval keeps getting better
BM25 + dense embeddings + reranking is outperforming pure semantic search on every benchmark I've tested. The tooling is maturing fast.

I've built RAG systems handling document Q&A across PDF, DOCX, and plain text with hybrid retrieval. The precision gains from tuning retrieval far outweigh what you get from just expanding context.

The future isn't RAG vs. long context. It's RAG with long context.

Agree? Disagree? I want to hear your production experience.

### Post 5: How I Built It (EnterpriseHub Deep Dive)

```
I built a full-stack AI platform from scratch. Here's an honest look at the architecture decisions -- what worked, what I'd change.

The project: EnterpriseHub -- a real estate AI and BI platform with lead qualification bots, CRM integration, and analytics dashboards.

What worked:

FastAPI with async everywhere. Real estate leads expect sub-5-second responses. Async request handling + Redis caching made that possible even with multiple AI provider calls per request.

3-tier caching (L1 memory, L2 Redis, L3 database). Most AI applications have zero caching. Adding this cut our average response time significantly and reduced API costs by 89%.

GoHighLevel CRM as the source of truth. Instead of building a custom CRM, I integrated with what the agents already use. Webhook-driven sync keeps everything current.

Streamlit for BI. For internal dashboards, Streamlit ships 10x faster than building a React frontend. Monte Carlo simulations, sentiment tracking, and churn prediction -- all built in days, not weeks.

What I'd do differently:

Start with better test infrastructure. I wrote tests after building features. TDD from day one would have caught integration issues earlier.

Use a message queue earlier. Direct API calls between bots work at low volume but don't scale gracefully. RabbitMQ or Redis Streams would have been worth the setup cost.

The codebase: 91+ API routes, 11 CI workflows, and it's all open source. Link in my featured section.

What architecture decisions have surprised you -- good or bad?
