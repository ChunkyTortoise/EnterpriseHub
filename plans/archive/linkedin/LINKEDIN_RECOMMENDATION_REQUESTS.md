## Template 1: Former Colleague/Collaborator

**Context**: Someone who worked with you directly on a technical project

**Message:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> I hope you're doing well! I'm building out my LinkedIn profile and would really appreciate a recommendation from you. Working together on [specific project] was a highlight for me, especially how we tackled [specific technical challenge like "the multi-agent handoff logic" or "the RAG pipeline optimization"].
>
> If you have a few minutes, I'd love if you could speak to our collaboration on [project name], particularly around my work with [FastAPI/Python/LLM integration/system architecture]. Any insights about how we solved [specific problem] or my approach to [code quality/testing/problem-solving] would be incredibly helpful.
>
> No pressure if you're swamped—I know how it goes! Let me know if there's anything I can do to return the favor.

Your mentorship around [specific area like "system design" or "production-grade Python"] has been formative in how I approach engineering problems, and I still reference [specific advice or project] regularly.
>
> If you have time, I'd love if you could speak to my growth in [LLMOps/multi-agent systems/FastAPI development] and how I approach [technical challenges/code architecture/problem-solving]. Your perspective on my progression from [earlier stage] to [current capabilities] would be especially meaningful.

## Recommendation Request Strategy

### Prioritization (Target 3-5 recommendations)
1. **High priority**: Former colleagues, clients (Template 1-2) — direct work experience
2. **Medium priority**: Mentors, peer developers (Template 3-4) — technical credibility
3. **Lower priority**: Open-source users (Template 5) — community validation

### Timing
- Send requests in batches of 2-3 per week (avoid mass requests)
- Follow up after 7-10 days if no response (one gentle reminder max)
- Offer to write reciprocal recommendations for peers

### What to Highlight (Guide for Recommenders)
Ask recommenders to mention:
- **Technical skills**: Python, FastAPI, LangChain, RAG systems, multi-agent orchestration
- **Project examples**: EnterpriseHub, jorge_real_estate_bots, docqa-engine, insight-engine
- **Soft skills**: Problem-solving, collaboration, code quality, testing discipline
- **Business impact**: Automation, cost reduction, scalability, user experience

### Success Metrics
- **Goal**: 3-5 recommendations within 30 days
- **Quality markers**: Specific project mentions, technical depth, business outcomes
- **Profile boost**: Increases trust signals for recruiters and potential clients
