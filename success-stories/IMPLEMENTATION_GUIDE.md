## 🆘 Troubleshooting Common Challenges

### Challenge: "Client won't participate in case study"

**Solutions**:
- Offer anonymity (industry + size, no company name)
- Start with testimonial instead (lower commitment)
- Offer incentives (free features, priority support)
- Ask: "What concerns do you have?" and address them

### Challenge: "Metrics aren't as strong as expected"

**Solutions**:
- Focus on qualitative benefits (stress reduction, team morale)
- Use percentage improvements instead of absolute numbers
- Compare to industry benchmarks (even moderate improvements can be impressive)
- Wait longer for ROI to compound before documenting

### Challenge: "Sales team not using the assets"

**Solutions**:
- Make assets easier to find (central repository, search function)
- Train on specific use cases (when to use which template)
- Track usage and celebrate wins ("Sarah used the Premier case study and closed a $50K deal!")
- Get feedback: "What's missing? What would make this more useful?"

### Challenge: "Assets feel generic or templated"

**Solutions**:
- Add more client-specific details (unique quotes, specific challenges)
- Include unexpected results or surprising insights
- Use storytelling techniques (conflict, resolution, transformation)
- Incorporate emotion (frustration, excitement, relief)
