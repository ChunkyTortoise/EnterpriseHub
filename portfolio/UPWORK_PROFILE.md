## Profile Title
AI Technical Co-Founder | Autonomous Agent Architect (LangGraph) | Python/Streamlit Expert

## Specialized Profile: AI Agent Architect & Technical Co-Founder

**"I build AI systems that build themselves."**

I specialize in creating **autonomous multi-agent swarms** that function as a technical co-founder. Instead of just "chatting" with an AI, I build systems where agents like "Architect," "Engineer," and "DevOps" collaborate to write code, manage GitHub repositories, and deploy applications autonomously.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Self-Evolving Systems:** Agents that can modify their own source code to add new tools.
- **LangGraph Orchestration:** Stateful multi-agent workflows (Plan -> Code -> Test -> Deploy).
- **Full-Stack Autonomy:** Agents with read/write access to File System, GitHub API, and CLIs.
- **Safety First:** "Guardian" agents that audit code for security before deployment.

## Sample Upwork Proposals

### For "AI Technical Co-Founder" Projects

**Subject:** I've already built your "Technical Co-Founder" (LangGraph + Claude Swarm)

Hi [Client Name],

I read your job post for an "AI Technical Co-Founder" and it describes **ARETE**, the autonomous swarm system I have already built and deployed.

**You need:** An agent that can converse, manage files, write code, and deploy it.
**I have built:** A 5-agent swarm (Prime, Architect, Engineer, Guardian, DevOps) that does exactly this.

**My Approach:**
1. **Architecture:** I use **LangGraph** for state management, not just a simple chain. This allows the "Engineer" agent to loop through "Code -> Test -> Fix" cycles autonomously.
2. **Safety:** My "Guardian" agent acts as a safety layer, auditing code for security risks before the "DevOps" agent is allowed to commit to GitHub.
3. **Memory:** I use a dual-memory system (File-based logs + Vector DB) so the agent never forgets a decision.

**Why me?**
- **Experience:** I have shipped production LangGraph swarms, not just tutorials.
- **Stack:** Expert in Claude 3.5 Sonnet (best for coding), Python, and GitHub Actions.
- **Speed:** I can deploy the "Core Agent" (Phase 1) in <2 weeks because I have the reusable architecture ready.

**Case Study:**
Check out my "ARETE Swarm" architecture here: [Link to Portfolio/Case Study]

I am available to start immediately and can deliver the Phase 1 prototype for your budget of $4,000-6,000.

Best,
Cayman Roden
