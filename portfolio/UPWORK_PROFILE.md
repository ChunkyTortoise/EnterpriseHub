# Upwork Profile

## Title
AI/LLM Application Developer | Python/FastAPI/Streamlit | 1,768h Certified

## Overview

I build AI-powered applications with Python, FastAPI, and Streamlit. My projects include multi-bot lead qualification systems, LLM orchestration libraries, and automated proposal pipelines.

Everything I build is tested, documented, and on GitHub.

### What I Build

- **AI agent systems** -- Multi-bot architectures with handoff logic, context management, and CRM integration
- **LLM orchestration** -- Provider-agnostic clients with fallback routing, response caching, and cost tracking
- **FastAPI backends** -- Async APIs with Pydantic validation, JWT auth, PostgreSQL, Redis caching
- **Streamlit dashboards** -- BI dashboards with Plotly visualizations, real-time data, and WebSocket updates
- **Automation pipelines** -- Job scanners, proposal generators, and outreach engines

### Certifications (1,768+ Hours, All Verifiable)
