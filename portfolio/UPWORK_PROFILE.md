# Upwork Profile

## Title
AI/LLM Application Developer | Python/FastAPI/Streamlit | 1,768h Certified

## Overview

I build AI-powered applications with Python, FastAPI, and Streamlit. My projects include multi-bot lead qualification systems, LLM orchestration libraries, data analytics platforms, RAG document Q&A engines, and automated scraping frameworks.

Everything I build is tested, documented, and on GitHub. All repos have CI, demo modes, and zero-key quick starts.

### What I Build

- **AI agent systems** -- Multi-bot architectures with handoff logic, context management, and CRM integration
- **LLM orchestration** -- Provider-agnostic clients with fallback routing, response caching, and cost tracking
- **RAG & document Q&A** -- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense vectors), source citations, prompt engineering labs
- **Data analytics dashboards** -- Auto-profiling, predictive modeling, marketing attribution, PDF reports
- **FastAPI backends** -- Async APIs with Pydantic validation, JWT auth, PostgreSQL, Redis caching
- **Streamlit dashboards** -- BI dashboards with Plotly visualizations, real-time data, interactive filters
- **Web scraping frameworks** -- YAML-configurable scrapers, competitor price monitoring, change detection
- **Automation pipelines** -- Job scanners, proposal generators, Excel-to-web converters, outreach engines
