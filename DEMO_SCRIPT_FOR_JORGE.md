2. Show a lead profile with the "Next Best Action" section
3. Point out the specific recommendation and confidence score

**Script**:
> "See this? The AI analyzes every lead's behavior and tells you exactly what to do next. If a lead viewed a listing 3 times but hasn't responded, it recommends a video walkthrough with 73% confidence. This is based on patterns from thousands of successful conversions."

**Business Impact**:
- Prioritize follow-ups automatically
- Catch cooling leads before they go cold
- 15% increase in re-engagement success

**Demo Scenarios**:
- **Hot Lead** (80-100): Recent engagement, high response rate → "Strike while hot!"

- **Cold Lead** (0-49): Low engagement → "Re-engagement campaign needed"

## 🤖 Part 3: Smart Automation (5 minutes)

### Feature 6: Optimal Send Time Prediction

**What to Show**:
1. Navigate to "Smart Automation"
2. Show the send time prediction for different leads
3. Explain how it learns from each lead's behavior

**Script**:

**How It Works**:
- Analyzes response patterns for each lead
- Considers day of week, time of day, message type

**Business Impact**:

1. Show example A/B test results
2. Point out the winner (Variant B: 14% better)
3. Explain the statistical significance

**Script**:
> "We don't guess what works—we test it. Here's an A/B test we ran: Variant A was your standard message, Variant B added social proof. Result? Variant B performed 14% better with statistical confidence. Now we automatically use the winning message for all new leads."

**Test Examples**:
- Subject line variations
- Message length (short vs detailed)
- Call-to-action phrasing
- Personalization level

**Business Impact**:
- Data-driven optimization
- Continuous improvement
- Eliminate underperforming messages

### Feature 8: Sequence Performance Analytics

**What to Show**:
1. Show sequence analytics with response rates
2. Highlight the "break-up" message success (44% response)
3. Show drop-off points in sequences

**Script**:
> "This tells you exactly which messages in your sequences work and which don't. See this 'break-up' message at the end of sequences? It gets a 44% response rate—higher than any other message. That's because it creates urgency. Now you can optimize every sequence based on real data."

**Key Metrics**:
- Open rate per message position
- Response rate by message type
- Drop-off analysis
- Best-performing message positions

**Business Impact**:
- Optimize sequences for maximum conversion
