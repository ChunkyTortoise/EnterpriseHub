# Master Service Agreement: Technical Governance & Architectural Services

**Parties:** [Your Name] ("Principal Architect") and Lyrio.io / Jorge Sales ("Enterprise Client")
**Effective Date:** January 11, 2026

## 1. Scope of Engagement
The Principal Architect agrees to provide strategic technical services as defined in individual Statements of Work (SOW). Services include, but are not limited to: Custom AI Middleware Development, Agentic Workflow Orchestration, and Technical Scaling Governance.

## 2. Compensation & Value-Based Models
This agreement supports various strategic compensation structures as defined in the SOW:
*   **Precision Engineering (Fixed-Price):** 50% initiation fee, 50% upon successful deployment and UAT (User Acceptance Testing).
*   **Architectural Licensing:** A recurring fee for access to the Principal Architect’s proprietary middleware and APIs.
*   **Strategic Revenue Participation:** Payouts based on the volume of users or revenue generated by specific architectural enhancements.

## 3. Intellectual Property & Governance
*   **Core Architecture (The Brain):** All pre-existing logic, proprietary prompts, middleware code, and "Architectural Engines" remain the sole intellectual property of the Principal Architect.
*   **Operational License:** The Client is granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to utilize the APIs and middleware for the duration of the engagement.
*   **Client Deliverables:** Custom branding, UI assets, and GHL-specific configuration built explicitly for the Client shall be owned by the Client upon final settlement of all related invoices.

## 4. Revenue Integrity & Audit Governance
For performance-linked models, the Client agrees to provide transparent access to the necessary "Single Source of Truth" (e.g., GHL Smart List, Middleware Telemetry). The Principal Architect reserves the right to perform a quarterly technical audit to ensure revenue integrity.

## 5. Deployment, Maintenance & Deactivation
*   **Governance Standard:** All code will be deployed to a secure, Principal Architect-managed environment (e.g., Railway/AWS) to ensure uptime and IP security.
*   **Suspension of Service:** In the event of non-payment exceeding 14 days, the Principal Architect reserves the right to suspend API access and deactivate proprietary middleware endpoints.
*   **Termination:** Either party may terminate the engagement with 30 days' written notice.

## 6. Liability & Architectural Warranty
The Principal Architect provides a 30-day "Architectural Integrity Warranty" on all new deployments. Total liability is limited to the fees paid by the Client in the three (3) months preceding any claim.
