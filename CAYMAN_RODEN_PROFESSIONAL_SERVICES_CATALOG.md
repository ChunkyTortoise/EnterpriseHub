**NEW SERVICE - Responding to Mid-Market Demand for AI Strategy**

**Certifications:** All 19 certifications provide strategic foundation

**The Problem:** You need someone to lead AI strategy across your company, but can't afford a full-time Chief AI Officer ($250,000+ annual salary). Consultants charge $10,000+/week. You need ongoing strategic guidance, not one-off projects.

## SECTION 26: CUSTOM API DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION

**The Integration Bridge: Connect your systems through custom APIs**

**NEW SERVICE - High Demand for System Integration**

**Certifications:** Python for Everybody, IBM GenAI Engineering, Microsoft AI & ML Engineering

**The Problem:** Your systems don't talk to each other. Data is manually copied between systems. You're building custom workflows manually instead of automating them. You need APIs but building them in-house is expensive and time-consuming.

- Data accuracy issues: 2-3% errors requiring correction = $10,000/year value
- With integrated APIs: Eliminate manual entry
- Savings: $45,000 + $10,000 = $55,000/year
- Additional benefit: Real-time inventory visibility prevents stockouts
- Typical stockout prevention value: $30,000-$50,000/year
