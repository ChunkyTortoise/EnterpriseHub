Hi Sarah,

[CUSTOMIZE: HOOK — Reference their specific document type, volume, and pain point. Examples below.]

I've built RAG systems from scratch and optimized existing ones for accuracy and cost. Here's what's directly relevant to your project:

[CUSTOMIZE: BULLET 1 — Choose most relevant from proof points library]

[CUSTOMIZE: BULLET 2 — Secondary technical capability]

[CUSTOMIZE: BULLET 3 — Cost/performance metric if they mentioned budget concerns]

The architecture I'd propose: [CUSTOMIZE: EMBEDDING MODEL] for vectors, [CUSTOMIZE: VECTOR DB] for storage, FastAPI for the API layer, and Redis for caching frequent queries. I tune chunking strategy and retrieval method to the document type — what works for legal contracts is different from what works for technical manuals.

[CUSTOMIZE: CTA — Choose from library based on client engagement level]
