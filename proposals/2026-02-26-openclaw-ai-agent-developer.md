## Cover Letter

Hi,

OpenClaw is my primary consulting vertical — I've built a practice around it and deployed it in production for a law firm last week. If you want someone who goes beyond the OpenClaw docs, I'm likely the right fit.

**What I've built with OpenClaw:**

- Deployed an AI Strategy system for Jordan Jewkes (attorney) using OpenClaw as the orchestration layer — configured custom tool chains, system prompt architecture, and multi-step workflows tailored to legal intake and client communication
- Built the OpenClaw Consulting vertical with tiered pricing ($1.5K–$15K enterprise) covering: initial audit, configuration, workflow design, staff training, and ongoing retainer support
- Deep familiarity with OpenClaw's agent configuration, prompt injection prevention, tool-use patterns, and production hardening

**Why this matters for your project:**

Almost nobody has production OpenClaw experience. Most "AI agent developers" on Upwork have never touched it. I've configured it, deployed it, and handed it off to a non-technical client with documentation — which means I can do the same for you, faster.

**What else I bring:**

- 11 production AI repos, 8,500+ automated tests, all CI green
- AgentForge multi-agent framework: 4.3M tool dispatches/sec, P99 latency 0.095ms
- 89% LLM cost reduction via 3-tier caching across production deployments
- IBM Generative AI Engineering + IBM RAG and Agentic AI + Anthropic Claude Code in Action certifications
- 20+ years software engineering, US-based (PST)

**Live demos you can try right now:**
- Agent orchestration: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/
- Prompt engineering lab: https://ct-prompt-lab.streamlit.app/

I'm available 30+ hrs/week and can start within 48 hours.

What does the project entail? I'd like to understand the specific workflows you're trying to automate before our first call.

Best,
Cayman Roden
