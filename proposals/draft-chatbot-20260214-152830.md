Hi Mike,

[CUSTOMIZE: HOOK — Reference their specific use case, industry, or described pain point. Examples below.]

I build production AI chatbots with Python and FastAPI. Here's what's directly relevant:

[CUSTOMIZE: BULLET 1 — Choose most relevant from proof points library]

[CUSTOMIZE: BULLET 2 — Secondary technical capability]

[CUSTOMIZE: BULLET 3 — Integration or deployment detail if mentioned]

My stack for this kind of work: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis + [CUSTOMIZE: Claude/OpenAI/Gemini] depending on the use case. I also have benchmarks and test suites for every chatbot I've built — 360+ tests across real estate bots alone.

[CUSTOMIZE: CTA — Choose from library based on urgency and budget]
