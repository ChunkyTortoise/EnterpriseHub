## Cover Letter

Hi,

RAG + agent systems is my full-time specialization. I've shipped 11 production repos in this space with 8,500+ automated tests.

**What I bring to your RAG agent projects**:

1. **Production RAG Pipeline** (not a tutorial project):
   - Hybrid retrieval: BM25 + semantic search + cross-encoder re-ranking
   - 0.88 citation faithfulness -- every AI response traceable to source documents
   - Semantic chunking with configurable overlap for different document types
   - 88% cache hit rate via 3-tier caching (L1 in-memory, L2 Redis, L3 semantic)

2. **Agentic AI Architecture**:
   - Multi-agent orchestration framework: 4.3M tool dispatches/sec throughput
   - Confidence-scored routing between specialized agents
   - Pattern learning from historical outcomes (thresholds improve over time)
   - Full audit trail with governance policies

3. **Fast Delivery**:
   - I work 30+ hrs/week and deliver daily commits
   - Existing codebases mean I'm not starting from zero -- I'm adapting proven architecture
   - First working prototype within the first week
   - Comprehensive test coverage (80%+ minimum) on every delivery

**Key metrics from recent deployments**:
- 89% LLM cost reduction ($3,600/mo to $400/mo)
- P99 agent coordination: 0.095ms
- 205 passing tests on the most recent bot deployment
- Zero context loss during agent-to-agent handoffs

**Live demos** (try before you hire):
- RAG pipeline: https://ct-prompt-lab.streamlit.app/
- Agent orchestration: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/

I'd love to discuss your specific RAG agent requirements. Available for a call this week.

Best,
Cayman Roden
