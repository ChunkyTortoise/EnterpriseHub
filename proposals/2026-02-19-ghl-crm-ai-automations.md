## Cover Letter

Hi,

I'm a GoHighLevel + AI specialist with a production system managing a $50M+ pipeline. This isn't theoretical -- I built and deployed the full CRM + AI orchestration stack.

**What I've built on GoHighLevel**:

1. **Multi-Bot AI System** (3 specialized bots):
   - **Lead Bot**: Qualifies new leads with temperature scoring (Hot/Warm/Cold)
   - **Buyer Bot**: Financial readiness assessment, property matching, pre-approval tracking
   - **Seller Bot**: Motivation scoring, timeline urgency, property condition assessment
   - All three coordinate through confidence-scored handoffs with zero context loss

2. **CRM Integration**:
   - Real-time GHL sync: contact fields, tags, pipeline stages, custom fields
   - 10 req/sec rate-limited API client (respects GHL limits)
   - Automated workflow triggers based on lead temperature
   - Custom field mapping for all qualification data

3. **AI Cost Optimization**:
   - 3-tier Redis caching: 88% hit rate, 89% cost reduction
   - Multi-LLM orchestration (Claude + Gemini with fallback chains)
   - Sub-200ms orchestration overhead

4. **Funnel Integration**:
   - AI-powered lead capture forms with instant qualification
   - Automated follow-up sequences based on bot analysis
   - A/B testing service for conversion optimization

5. **Compliance Built In**:
   - TCPA opt-out handling (STOP/unsubscribe detection)
   - Fair Housing guardrails (FHA/RESPA compliance)
   - PII encryption, audit trails, SMS length compliance (320 char)

**Key metrics**:
- $50M+ pipeline managed
- 205 passing tests on the bot system
- 89% LLM cost reduction
- P99 coordination: 0.095ms

**I can handle the full scope**: CRM setup, funnel architecture, workflow automation, AND the AI layer. Most GHL experts do CRM only. I do CRM + AI as an integrated system.
