## Cover Letter

Hi,

Agentic workflow systems and LLM configuration are the core of what I build — not a side project. With fewer than 5 proposals on this job, I want to make sure you see what production-grade AI engineering actually looks like.

**What I've shipped that's directly relevant:**

**AgentForge** — multi-agent orchestration framework I built from scratch:
- 4.3M tool dispatches/sec throughput
- Confidence-scored handoffs between specialized agents with zero context loss
- Learned routing thresholds that improve from historical outcomes
- P99 coordination latency: 0.095ms
- Live demo: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/

**Jorge Real Estate AI** — production 3-bot agentic system (deployed, live):
- Lead Bot → Buyer Bot → Seller Bot with intelligent handoff logic
- GoHighLevel CRM integration, TCPA compliance pipeline, calendar booking
- 89% LLM cost reduction via 3-tier Redis caching (L1/L2/L3)
- 454 automated tests, deployed on Render

**Production engineering baseline** (not prototypes):
- 11 repos, 8,500+ automated tests, all CI green
- FastAPI async backends, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitHub Actions
- P50/P95/P99 benchmarks with alerting in every repo

**My approach for your project:**

I'd start with an audit of your current LLM configuration and workflow design, then propose a phased delivery:
1. Architecture review + gap analysis (Days 1-2)
2. Core workflow implementation (Days 3-7)
3. Testing, tuning, and documentation (Days 8-10)

**Credentials:**
- IBM Generative AI Engineering (PyTorch, LangChain, Hugging Face) — 144 hours
- IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate
- Duke LLMOps Specialization
- Anthropic Claude Code in Action
- 21 certifications, 1,831 hours total

I'm US-based, available 30+ hrs/week, and can start within 48 hours. The <5 proposal count tells me this listing is fresh — I'd like to be your first substantive conversation.

Can you share more about the current state of your agentic system and what "LLM configuration" work is most urgent?

Best,

## Submission Notes

**Rate**: $1,800 fixed — don't discount (this is expert-level work at market rate)
**Availability**: 30+ hrs/week, start within 48 hours
**Risk note**: Nigeria client, $0 Upwork spend — proceed but watch for scope creep; get clear deliverables in contract
**Question to ask client**: "Can you describe the current state of your agentic system and what the primary bottleneck is?"
**Milestone suggestion**: Split into 2 milestones — $900 at architecture/design sign-off, $900 at final delivery

## READY-TO-SUBMIT-HUMAN

Copy the Cover Letter section above and paste into Upwork proposal form.
Flag the $0-spend client risk — request milestone payments, not lump sum.
