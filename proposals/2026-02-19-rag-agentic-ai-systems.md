## Cover Letter

Hi,

I build production RAG and multi-agent AI systems -- this is my core specialization, not a side skill.

Here's what I bring to this engagement:

**RAG Pipeline Expertise (Production-Grade)**:
- Built a hybrid retrieval system using BM25 + semantic search + re-ranking with 0.88 citation faithfulness score
- 3-tier caching (L1 in-memory, L2 Redis, L3 semantic) achieving 88% cache hit rate and 89% LLM cost reduction
- Document ingestion pipeline handling multiple formats with semantic chunking

**Multi-Agent / Agentic AI Systems**:
- Built AgentForge: a multi-agent orchestration framework processing 4.3M tool dispatches/sec
- Confidence-scored handoffs between specialized agents with zero context loss
- Learned handoff thresholds that improve routing accuracy from historical outcomes
- P99 coordination latency: 0.095ms

**Production Engineering**:
- 11 production repos with 8,500+ automated tests, all CI green
- FastAPI async backends with PostgreSQL + Redis
- Docker + GitHub Actions CI/CD for every repo
- P50/P95/P99 latency benchmarks with configurable alerting

**Directly Relevant Repos** (all open-source with live demos):
1. `advanced_rag_system` -- Production RAG with hybrid retrieval, multi-source ingestion, caching
2. `agentforge` -- Multi-agent orchestration engine with governance, routing, auto-scaling
3. `ghl_real_estate_ai` -- 3-bot system (Lead/Buyer/Seller) with CRM integration

**Live demos**:
- RAG system: https://ct-prompt-lab.streamlit.app/
- Agent orchestration: https://ai-orchest-7mnwp9untg7gyyvchzevid.streamlit.app/

I can start within 48 hours and deliver a working prototype in the first week.

Best,
Cayman Roden
