# Priority 0: Close Matthew Postlethwaite — First Upwork Review

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Status**: WARM LEAD — $200 build already agreed verbally

---

## Why This Is Priority 0

Matthew has already agreed to a $200 build. This is not a proposal — this is closing a deal that's already been negotiated. Getting this contract opened, delivering it in 1-2 days, and earning a 5-star review is the single highest-leverage action available right now.

A 5-star review from Matthew unlocks:
- Higher response rates on all future proposals (clients filter by reviews)
- Ability to bid on "1+ review required" jobs
- Social proof to reference in proposals ("just delivered a Mac Mini deployment for a client last week")

**This beats submitting 10 more proposals with 0 reviews.**

## Action Steps

### Step 1: Send Follow-Up Message (Do Today)
If you haven't already opened the Upwork contract, send this message:

---

Hi Matthew,

Following up on our conversation — I'm ready to start on the Mac Mini OpenClaw deployment whenever you are. To get the contract opened on Upwork, you'll need to initiate it from your side (invite me to the job or send a contract offer).

Once it's open, I can have everything running within 24-48 hours:
- OpenClaw installed and configured on the Mac Mini
- 24/7 agent loop with automatic restart
- Written handoff doc so you can manage it going forward

Let me know when you're ready to proceed.

Best,
Cayman

### Step 2: Scope Lock (Before Work Starts)
Get written confirmation (even in Upwork messages) of:
- [ ] Exactly what the agent should do (the task/workflow)
- [ ] What "done" looks like
- [ ] Mac Mini access method (remote screen share, SSH, etc.)
- [ ] Timeline expectation (1-2 days is your promise)

### Step 3: Deliver Fast
- Do not over-engineer. $200 = working deployment + handoff doc. Period.
- Target: contract open Day 0, delivery Day 1-2, review requested Day 2-3

### Step 4: Request the Review
After delivery, send:

> "Really glad it's working for you! If you have a moment, an honest review on Upwork would mean a lot — it's how new freelancers get off the ground. Here's the link: [Upwork review link]"

## Notes

- Matthew's ask matches the Mac Mini OpenClaw job (#2) — you can reference that proposal for scope framing
- Do NOT combine this with other work or upsell aggressively yet. Get the review first.
- After the review, you can pitch the $500/mo retainer for ongoing support
