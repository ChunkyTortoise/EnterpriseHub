## Cover Letter

Hi,

This is exactly the kind of deployment I've been doing for clients — OpenClaw on local hardware with 24/7 agent operation. I can have this running for you in 1-2 days.

**My OpenClaw experience:**

I run an OpenClaw consulting practice and deployed it in production for a law firm client last week. I know the configuration quirks, how to set up persistent agent loops, and how to make it reliable on Mac hardware specifically.

**What I'll deliver for this project:**

- OpenClaw installed, configured, and tested on your Mac Mini
- 24/7 agent configuration with automatic restart on crash (launchd service or equivalent)
- Custom system prompt and tool configuration tuned to your use case
- Monitoring setup so you know when agents are running vs. stuck
- Written handoff doc so you can manage it yourself going forward

**This is a quick win — but I want it to become an ongoing relationship.** After deployment, most clients find they want additional agents configured, new workflows built, or help with prompt tuning. I offer a retainer starting at $500/month for ongoing OpenClaw support.

**Why me over other applicants:**

Almost no one on Upwork has production OpenClaw experience. I've deployed it, documented it, and handed it to a non-technical client. I'll do the same for you in under 48 hours.

I'm US-based (Palm Springs, CA), available immediately, and can start within 24 hours of contract.

What's the primary task you want the agents to handle?

Best,
Cayman Roden
