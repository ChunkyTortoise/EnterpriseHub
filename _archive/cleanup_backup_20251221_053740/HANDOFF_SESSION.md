# Session Handoff - 24-Hour Monetization Sprint

## CONTEXT
User is an overqualified engineer needing to generate revenue in 24 hours. Two projects evaluated:
- **EnterpriseHub** (`/Users/Cave/Desktop/enterprise-hub/EnterpriseHub`)
- **AgentForge** (`/Users/Cave/Desktop/agentforge`)

## DECISION: Focus on EnterpriseHub
- Live demo already deployed: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/
- 301 tests, 85% coverage, production-ready
- Pre-written marketing assets exist

## STRATEGY: LinkedIn/Freelancing First
Digital products are slower (need audience). Freelancing gets cash in 24-72 hours.

### Services to Offer:
| Service | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Quick CVP Audit | $150-300 |
| Custom Dashboard MVP | $500-1,500 |
| AI Integration Consult | $200/hr |

## NEXT STEP: Finish LinkedIn/Upwork Profiles
User requested help optimizing profiles. Need:
1. User's LinkedIn URL (to fetch and analyze)
2. User's Upwork URL (if exists)
3. Target client type (SaaS founders? Agencies? Finance teams?)

## KEY ASSETS READY TO USE
- `/assets/UPWORK_PROPOSALS.md` - Pre-written pitch templates
- `/assets/LINKEDIN_POSTS.md` - Social media content
- `/assets/DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT_60SEC.md` - Video script
- `/scenarios/*.md` - 3 industry templates (can become digital products later)

## LINKEDIN POST DRAFT (Ready to Use)
```
I just built an AI-powered financial modeling tool that does
what Bloomberg charges $24k/year for.

Live demo: [streamlit link]

Looking for 2-3 founders who need:
→ Break-even analysis
→ Pricing optimization
→ Marketing ROI dashboards

First project: 50% off my normal rate.

DM me "MARGIN" if interested.
```
