I need to integrate advanced production features from jorge_deployment_package into the jorge_real_estate_bots MVP to create an enterprise-grade platform.

CURRENT STATUS (Just Completed):
✅ Production API server bug fixed and validated (jorge_claude_intelligence.py:450)
✅ API running on localhost:8001 - fully operational (339ms response times)
✅ Dashboard running on localhost:8503 with real data
✅ Test results: Lead scoring, Jorge validation, 5-minute rule all working

PHASE 1 MISSION (8 hours - Start Now):
Extract and integrate 3 CRITICAL files:

1. jorge_claude_intelligence.py (722 lines) → bots/lead_bot/services/
   - PerformanceCache: <100ms cache hits (memory + file)
   - JorgeBusinessRules: $200K-$800K validation, service areas, commission calc
   - ClaudeLeadIntelligence: Hybrid pattern + AI, performance tracking
   - PerformanceMetrics: Tracking dataclass

2. jorge_kpi_dashboard.py (482 lines) → command_center/dashboard.py
   - 7 dashboard sections (metrics, funnel, trends, performance, etc.)
   - Real-time data with auto-refresh
   - Hot leads alerts, export capabilities

3. jorge_fastapi_lead_bot.py (618 lines) → Merge with bots/lead_bot/main.py
   - Performance monitoring middleware
   - Pydantic models (LeadMessage, GHLWebhook, LeadAnalysisResponse)
   - 5-minute rule enforcement
   - Background task processing

CONTEXT FILES TO READ FIRST:
1. ~/Documents/GitHub/EnterpriseHub/jorge_deployment_package/NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md (COMPLETE GUIDE - READ THIS FIRST)
2. ~/Documents/GitHub/EnterpriseHub/jorge_deployment_package/USEFUL_CODE_ANALYSIS.md (File-by-file analysis)
3. ~/Documents/GitHub/EnterpriseHub/jorge_deployment_package/EXTRACTABLE_CODE_INDEX.md (Quick reference)

CRITICAL NOTES:
⚠️ Bug at line 450 is ALREADY FIXED (budget_max access corrected)
⚠️ DO NOT copy .env file (production secrets)
⚠️ Test incrementally after each extraction
⚠️ Keep MVP's clean structure, add production features

STARTING POINT:
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/jorge_real_estate_bots
git checkout -b feature/integrate-production-phase1

Then follow Step-by-Step Integration Plan in NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md

Please start by reading NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md, then begin Phase 1 integration starting with extracting PerformanceCache from jorge_claude_intelligence.py.

Let's build an enterprise-grade Jorge Bot platform! 🚀
