# Quick Start for Next Session

**What to say to Claude Code in the next session:**

```
I need to integrate advanced features from jorge_deployment_package into
jorge_real_estate_bots. Please read these files first:

1. ~/Documents/GitHub/EnterpriseHub/jorge_deployment_package/CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md
2. ~/Documents/GitHub/EnterpriseHub/jorge_deployment_package/USEFUL_CODE_ANALYSIS.md
3. ~/Documents/GitHub/EnterpriseHub/jorge_deployment_package/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_REPORT.md

Then start Phase 1 integration: Extract jorge_claude_intelligence.py,
jorge_kpi_dashboard.py, and upgrade the FastAPI server.

Test after each extraction step. Let's build an enterprise-grade Jorge Bot platform! 🚀
```

## Super Quick Summary

**Discovered**: Two Jorge implementations
- **Production** (jorge_deployment_package): Advanced features, running dashboard, minor import fix needed
- **MVP** (jorge_real_estate_bots): Clean structure, good docs, basic features

**Mission**: Extract production's best code into MVP's clean architecture

**Phase 1** (8 hours):
1. Extract lead intelligence with performance caching
2. Extract KPI dashboard (7 sections, real-time)
3. Upgrade FastAPI server with monitoring

**Result**: Enterprise-grade Jorge Bot platform! 🎯
