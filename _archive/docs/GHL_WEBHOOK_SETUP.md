# 🛰️ GHL Webhook Setup Guide

This guide explains how to connect your GoHighLevel (GHL) workflows to the AI Conversion Engine.

## 1. Webhook URL
Your API endpoint for receiving webhooks is:
`https://your-domain.com/api/webhook`

*Note: For local testing, use a tool like **ngrok** to expose your local server.*

## 2. Configuration in GHL

To trigger AI processing when a lead interacts, follow these steps in GHL:

### Step A: Create a Workflow
1. Go to **Automations** -> **Workflows**.
2. Click **Create New Workflow** -> **Start from Scratch**.

### Step B: Set the Trigger
Add a trigger based on the event you want to analyze:
- **Contact Created** (For initial qualification)
- **Customer Replied** (For conversation analysis)
- **Opportunity Stage Changed** (For lifecycle tracking)

### Step C: Add the Webhook Action
1. Click the **+** button to add an action.
2. Select **Webhook**.
3. **Method**: `POST`
4. **URL**: Paste your Webhook URL (from Step 1).
5. **Payload**: Ensure all contact fields are included.

### Step D: Publish
1. Click **Save**.
2. Switch the workflow from **Draft** to **Published**.

## 3. Verified Event Types
The system is optimized to process the following GHL event structures:
- `contact_create`
- `contact_update`
- `inbound_message`
- `opportunity_status_change`

## 4. Security
All incoming webhooks are validated for the correct `location_id`. Ensure the `location_id` in the webhook payload matches a registered tenant in your AI dashboard.
