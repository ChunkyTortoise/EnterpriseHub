## 🎭 NEW: Cinematic UI v4.0 Design System
The EnterpriseHub has been upgraded to a high-contrast, editorial-grade design system optimized for high-ticket consulting and executive presentations.

### ⚡ Key Visual Elements:
1.  **Animated Mesh Backgrounds**: Implementation of a 20s ease-infinite mesh gradient (`radial-gradients`) that provides a subtle, luxury feel without compromising performance.
2.  **Glassmorphic Cards**: Backdrop-blur effects (10px) with opacified surface colors for a modern 2025/2026 "FinTech" aesthetic.
3.  **High-Vibrancy Accents**: Transitioned to "Editorial Mint" (#10B981) for success indicators and "Institutional Slate" for depth.
4.  **Animated Metrics**: Custom count-up components with integrated icons and high-impact delta indicators (±%).
5.  **Hover-Lift Interactions**: 3D transform effects (translateY(-8px)) on all interactive cards to improve tactile feedback.
6.  **Saturated Sidebar**: Pure-text navigation with hidden radio circles for a custom "SaaS Command Center" look.
