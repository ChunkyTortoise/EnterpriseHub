JORGE'S AI PLATFORM: NEXT PHASE DEVELOPMENT

I need to build a professional Next.js frontend for Jorge's AI Real Estate Platform. The backend is production-ready with excellent bot ecosystem - need to showcase it properly.

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: The existing bots are enterprise-grade and production-ready:
- Jorge Seller Bot: LangGraph confrontational qualification (95% accuracy)
- Lead Bot: Complete 3-7-30 day automation with voice integration
- ML Analytics: 28-feature pipeline (42.3ms response time)
- GHL Integration: Deep CRM connectivity with webhook validation
- 650+ tests with 80% coverage

CURRENT PROBLEM: Streamlit frontend is prototype quality, not client-ready

OBJECTIVE: Build Next.js professional platform that connects to existing backend services

KEY TASKS:
1. Read foundation documents to understand existing bot capabilities
2. Design Next.js architecture that leverages existing FastAPI backend
3. Create professional UI for existing bot services (don't rebuild bots!)
4. Add Claude concierge with omnipresent platform awareness
5. Mobile-optimize for real estate field work

IMPORTANT: DO NOT rebuild any bot logic - integrate with existing excellent services

RESOURCE FILES:
- NEXT_PHASE_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md (comprehensive development plan)
- CRITICAL_PLATFORM_FILES.md (prioritized reading list)
- AGENT_TASK_ASSIGNMENTS.md (multi-agent coordination)
- FRONTEND_PLATFORM_SPECS.md (technical specifications)

START WITH: Read CLAUDE.md and CRITICAL_PLATFORM_FILES.md to understand platform

SUCCESS METRIC: Jorge can confidently demonstrate platform to high-value clients
