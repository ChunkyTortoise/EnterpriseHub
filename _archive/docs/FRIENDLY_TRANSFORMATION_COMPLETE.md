## 💡 **KEY TRANSFORMATION INSIGHTS**

### **Conversation Style Evolution**

**Before (Confrontational)**:

**After (Friendly)**:
> "Hi! I'm excited to help you with your home sale. I'd love to learn more about your situation - what's motivating you to consider selling?"

### **Objection Handling Evolution**

**Before (Aggressive)**:
> "If you're not ready to move forward, I'm not the right person for you."

### **Question Delivery Evolution**

**Before (Pressure)**:
> "What specifically are you thinking about? Timeline, price, or whether you actually want to sell? Because if it's exploration, you're wasting both our time."
