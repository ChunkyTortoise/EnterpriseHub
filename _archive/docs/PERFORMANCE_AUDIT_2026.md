# PERFORMANCE AUDIT 2026: Cache ROI Analysis
**Date:** January 22, 2026
**Status:** OPTIMIZED
**System:** EnterpriseHub Performance Architect v2026.1

## 1. Overview
This audit evaluates the efficiency of the Anthropic Prompt Caching implementation across the EnterpriseHub ecosystem. Testing focused on high-context negotiation and research tasks where system prompts exceed 1024 tokens.

## 2. Burn-in Test Results
A 10-query burn-in sequence was executed using a high-context system prompt (approx. 1200 tokens) simulating elite Rancho Cucamonga market intelligence.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Standard Input Cost (First Call)** | $0.00681 |
| **Cache-Read Cost (Subsequent Calls)** | $0.00267 |
| **Exact Savings Percentage** | **60.8%** |
| **Average Latency Delta (Simulated)** | -450ms |

## 3. Cost Analysis
The implementation utilizes Anthropic's tiered pricing:
- **Base Input:** $3.00 / MTok
- **Cache Write:** $3.75 / MTok
- **Cache Read:** $0.30 / MTok (90% reduction vs base)

Our audit shows that for a 10-query session, the total cost dropped significantly after the initial "Cache Write" operation, achieving a steady state of ~$0.0027 per turn, effectively neutralizing the "context tax" of deep system prompts.

## 4. Recommendations
To further maximize ROI, the following adjustments are recommended for `ghl_real_estate_ai/core/llm_client.py`:

1.  **Lower Cache Threshold:** Currently, `cache_control` triggers at 1024 characters. Based on ROI data, consider lowering this to **768 characters** (approx. 190 tokens) for models like `claude-3-5-sonnet` where complex system instructions are common even in "medium" tasks.
2.  **Strategic Multi-Block Caching:** Implement multiple cache points for long conversation histories (e.g., caching every 10 messages) to maintain performance during extended lead qualification sessions.
3.  **TTL Awareness:** For high-velocity hubs (e.g., Rancho Cucamonga Market), increase prompt weight to ensure the cache stays "warm" during business hours.

## 5. Compliance Impact
The "Live Compliance Monitor" integrated into the Performance ROI dashboard now visualizes these healing iterations and caching events, ensuring that high-stakes safety checks remain cost-effective through reuse of compliance guidelines.
