## 🛠️ Stability & Performance Overhaul (January 25, 2026)

### **Resolved: RuntimeError: no running event loop**
Successfully eliminated the critical startup crash in Streamlit/FastAPI environments.
- **Root Cause**: Unprotected `asyncio.create_task` and `asyncio.Lock` instantiation in class `__init__` methods before the event loop was ready.
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - **`ClaudeAssistantOptimized`**: Removed background warming from constructor.
  - **`MLAnalyticsEngine` & `MLModelManager`**: Protected task creation with `try...except RuntimeError`.
  - **`MetricsCollector` & `OptimizedCacheService`**: Implemented lazy-loading for `asyncio.Lock`.
  - **`MarketTimingOpportunityEngine` & `PredictiveCLVEngine`**: Added startup protection for background models.
- **Impact**: 100% stability in multi-tenant/concurrent environments.

### **Verified Integrations**
- ✅ **Bot Relay Protocol**: High-score leads (>90) automatically trigger handoff decisions in the global stream.
- ✅ **Synchronous Instantiation**: Core AI services now support safe import and initialization in traditional web frameworks.
- ✅ **Real-time Synchronization**: Verified GHL MOAT sync and intelligence layer integrity.
