Subject: Ideas for Lyrio.io & Engagement Options

Hi Jorge,

I’ve taken some time to dig into Lyrio.io, and I’m impressed by what you’ve built. The AI CRM space is crowded, but your focus on [Real Estate specific features like voicemail drops/specific feature] really stands out.

I’ve been thinking about how I can best support your roadmap. Since I know budget is a factor but we both want to aim for high-quality output, I’ve put together a few different ways we could work together. 

My goal was to create options that give you flexibility—whether that’s a low-risk "fix this one thing" approach or a deeper partnership where I’m incentivized by Lyrio’s growth.

**Attached is a brief proposal outlining three models:**
1.  **The Sniper:** Fixed-price features with a **100% satisfaction guarantee** on the first project.
2.  **The Growth Partner:** Lower monthly fee + a share of the revenue/efficiency I generate.
3.  **The Technical Co-Pilot:** Minimal retainer + equity/profit share (Long-term alignment).

**Recommended Next Step:**
I've also included an **"Option 0: The Diagnostic"** ($250). I can audit your current AI/GHL setup, find the bottlenecks/leaks, and give you a prioritized roadmap. If you hire me to build anything from that roadmap, I'll credit the $250 back.

Is there a specific technical headache you're facing this week that I could look at?

Best,

[Your Name]
