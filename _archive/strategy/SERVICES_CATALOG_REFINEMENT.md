## RISK MITIGATION

### RISK 1: Execution Bandwidth
**Issue:** Multiple initiatives competing for time  
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize top 5 recommendations (Month 1 focus)
- Batch similar work (landing pages together, case studies together)
- Use templates to accelerate documentation
- Consider contractor for video production if needed

### RISK 2: Pricing Expectations
**Issue:** Existing clients might expect previous rates for new services  
**Mitigation:**
- Founding Client Program grandfathered at 30% discount (expires Q1 2026)
- Clear messaging: early adopters get better rates, new services market-rate
- Bundling incentivizes larger commitments

### RISK 3: New Service Delivery Quality
**Issue:** Adding 6 new services risks quality dilution  
**Mitigation:**
- Phase in new services (2-3 in Month 1, 2 more in Month 2-3, 1-2 in Month 4-6)
- Test with Founding Client projects first
- Maintain 300+ tests per project standard across all services
- Document workflows/templates to ensure consistency

### RISK 4: Competitive Response
**Issue:** Competitors might copy positioning or pricing  
**Mitigation:**
- Differentiate on execution and results (case studies prove capability)
- Deepen vertical expertise (harder to replicate than positioning)
- Build recurring revenue (harder to disrupt than project-based)
- Continuous service innovation (stay 6 months ahead)
