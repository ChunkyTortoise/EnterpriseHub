### Sample Post Templates

**Template 1: Metric-Focused**
```
Deployed a multi-agent lead qualification system last week.

The numbers:
• 95% faster response (45min → 2min)
• 89% reduction in AI costs (3-tier caching)
• 4,937 automated tests
• P95 latency <2s

Not a prototype. Production code with monitoring, rollback paths, and 99.9% uptime.

Full case study: [link]

#AI #MultiAgent #ProductionSystems
```

**Template 2: Educational**
```
3 caching strategies that reduced my AI API costs by 89%:

1. L1: Application memory for repeated queries (0.1ms access)
2. L2: Redis for cross-instance sharing (1-2ms access)  
3. L3: PostgreSQL for persistence + analytics (10-20ms access)

The key insight: Most AI queries are near-duplicates. Cache semantic embeddings, not just raw queries.

Implementation details: [GitHub link]

#LLMOps #CostOptimization #Redis #PostgreSQL
```

**Template 3: Behind-the-Scenes**
```
What 4,937 tests in a personal project looks like:

→ 1,200+ unit tests (isolated component testing)
→ 800+ integration tests (API contracts, database)
→ 600+ agent tests (conversation flows, handoffs)
→ 400+ cache tests (hit/miss, invalidation)
→ 300+ security tests (auth, PII handling)
→ 200+ performance tests (latency, throughput)
→ 100+ compliance tests (Fair Housing, CCPA)
→ 300+ E2E tests (full user journeys)

Why so many? Because "it works on my machine" doesn't work in production.
