# ✨ Premium Enhancements Summary - January 5, 2026

## What Was Enhanced (Last 1-2 Days)

### 🎯 **1. Conversation Intelligence - "Smart Context Awareness"**

**Before:**
- AI would sometimes ask redundant questions
- No pre-extraction from first message
- Generic question sequencing

**After (Enhanced):**
- ✅ **Pre-extracts data from FIRST message** - If someone says "I need a 3-bed house in Austin for $400k", AI already knows budget, location, and beds
- ✅ **Never asks what you already said** - Context-aware question prioritization
- ✅ **Smart field prioritization** - Asks Budget > Location > Timeline (most important first)
- ✅ **Detects wholesale vs listing intent** - Adjusts questions based on pathway

**Impact:** Leads feel heard, not interrogated. Higher engagement rates.
