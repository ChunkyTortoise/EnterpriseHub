Status: All updates committed and pushed
Next: Start new chat with Session 4

WHAT HAPPENED THIS SESSION


1. CONFIRMED PATH B WITH JOSE
   He wants GHL webhook integration (backend API, not standalone demo)

2. N8N INTEGRATION DISCOVERED
   Jose offered n8n login - this could change everything
   Might build IN n8n vs separate FastAPI

3. SENT CLARIFICATION DOCUMENT
   Professional formatted questionnaire to Jose
   11 critical questions about implementation

4. GEMINI EXPLORATION STARTED
   Created comprehensive prompt for Gemini to explore:
   - GHL automations
   - Closer Control setup
   - Tag structure
   - Qualifying workflows

5. ALL WORK COMMITTED & PUSHED
   Everything backed up to GitHub
   Ready for next session

CRITICAL FILES FOR NEXT SESSION


PRIMARY HANDOFF:
   → CONTINUE_HERE_SESSION_4.md (START HERE - complete context)

EXPLORATION TOOLS:
   → GEMINI_EXPLORATION_PROMPT.md (what Gemini is exploring)
   → SYSTEM_EXPLORATION_GUIDE.md (manual exploration backup)

CLIENT COMMUNICATION:
   → CLIENT_CLARIFICATION.md (questions sent to Jose)

REFERENCE:
   → NEXT_SESSION_START_HERE.md (original handoff)
   → SESSION_SUMMARY.md (Session 3 summary)

WHAT'S WAITING FOR YOU


IN PROGRESS:
   • Gemini exploring GHL/Closer Control (should be done)
   • Awaiting n8n credentials from Jose

TO REVIEW:
   • Gemini's exploration results
   • Jose's answers to 11 questions
   • n8n workflows (when access granted)

TO DECIDE:
   Architecture option:
   A. Build workflow in n8n (4-6 hours)
   B. Hybrid n8n + FastAPI (8-12 hours)
   C. Pure FastAPI backend (10-15 hours)


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

NEXT SESSION START


START NEW CHAT WITH:

"Continue GHL project - Session 4. Read CONTINUE_HERE_SESSION_4.md for context.

Current status:
- Gemini exploration results: [paste results or say 'still running']
- n8n access: [received or still waiting]
- Jose's clarification answers: [received or still waiting]

Ready to analyze findings and decide architecture."

KEY INSIGHTS


THE N8N FACTOR:
   If Jose has robust n8n setup with GHL integration, we can ship this
   in HOURS instead of DAYS by building workflow nodes instead of
   entire backend infrastructure.

WAIT BEFORE CODING:
   Don't start building until we see:
   1. Their existing n8n workflows
   2. Their GHL automation structure
   3. Which architecture makes most sense

CONFIDENCE: HIGH
   Client is cooperative, systems are accessible, we have multiple
   viable paths forward.

Session 3 complete. Ready for Session 4.
