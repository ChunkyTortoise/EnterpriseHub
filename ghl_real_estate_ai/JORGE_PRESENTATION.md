### The Solution:
AI analyzes every lead and tells you:
- **77% probability** this lead closes in 30 days
- **Best time to call:** Late morning (10-11am)
- **Hidden objection:** Budget concerns (proactively address)
- **Competitive threat:** Talking to RE/MAX (move fast!)

### Live Demo:
```
🔥 High Probability Close
This lead has a 77% probability of closing within 30 days
→ Action: Schedule in-person viewing within 48 hours

```

- Stop wasting time on tire-kickers
- **+15% conversion rate**

## 🎓 Slide 4: Feature #2 - Real-Time Agent Coaching

### The Problem:
New agents sound like amateurs, experienced agents get rusty

### The Solution:
AI whispers perfect responses during live conversations

**Example:**
```
Lead says: "The house needs a lot of work..."

AI Coach Suggests:
💬 "I hear you. That's why we offer two routes - cash offer 
   (quick, as-is) or listing (top dollar). Which matters 
   more to you right now, speed or maximum price?"

✨ Why it works: Gives them control, shows flexibility
```

### This Is YOUR Voice:
- Jorge's exact break-up texts
- Jorge's either/or closing questions
- Jorge's "real talk" style

### Business Impact:
- Turn rookies into closers overnight
- Every agent sounds like Jorge
- **+20% conversion rate**

---

## 🤖 Slide 5: Feature #3 - Smart Follow-Up Automation

### The Problem:
Leads ghost you. You forget to follow up. Money lost.

### The Solution:
Automated sequences that WORK

**The Magic Sequence:**
```
Day 3:  "Hey Carlos! Just checking in - still interested 
         in Doral or did life get busy?"
         
Day 5:  "Carlos - real talk. Are you actually still looking 
         or should we close your file?"
         
Day 7:  "Hey Carlos, last text! If you want back in later 
         just reply 'I'm back'"
```

### The Stats:
- **42% of "dead" leads respond** to break-up texts
- **Zero manual work** - runs on autopilot
- **Perfect timing** - messages sent when most likely to respond

### Business Impact:
- Never drop a lead again
- Recover thousands in lost revenue
- **+10% additional deals**

---

## 📊 Slide 6: Feature #4 - Deal Closing Predictor
