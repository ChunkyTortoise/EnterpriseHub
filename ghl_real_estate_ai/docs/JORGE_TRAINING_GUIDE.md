## 📱 Part 1: Basic Operation

### Turning AI On for a Lead

**When to Use:**
- Lead responds positively to outreach
- You want AI to qualify them before spending time
- Lead enters your "needs qualifying" stage

**How to Do It:**

1. Open the contact in GHL
2. Click "Tags" 
3. Add tag: **"AI Assistant: ON"**
4. Within 10 seconds, the contact receives their first qualifying SMS

**Example First Message:**
> "Hey! Quick question - what's your budget range looking like?"

---

### Turning AI Off for a Lead

**When to Use:**
- Lead becomes hot (score 70+) - AI does this automatically
- Lead asks to speak with a human
- You want to take over manually

**How to Do It:**

1. Open the contact
2. Add tag: **"AI Assistant: OFF"**
3. Remove tag: **"AI Assistant: ON"**
4. AI stops messaging immediately

## 🎯 Part 2: Understanding Lead Scores

### The Scoring System

Your AI uses Jorge's exact criteria:

| Score | Status | Meaning | Action |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| 85-100 | **Hot** 🔥 | Answered 3+ questions | AI hands off to you automatically |
| 50-70 | **Warm** 🌤️ | Answered 2 questions | AI continues qualifying |
| 0-40 | **Cold** ❄️ | Answered 1 or less | AI waits before re-engaging |

### What AI Asks

The AI qualifies leads on these key points:

1. **Budget Range** - "What's your budget range looking like?"
2. **Location** - "Which neighborhoods are you eyeing?"
3. **Bedrooms** - "How many bedrooms do you need?"
4. **Timeline** - "When are you hoping to make a move?"
5. **Pre-approval** - "Are you pre-approved or do you need a lender?"
6. **Motivation** - "What's driving the decision right now?"

### When AI Hands Off

When a lead reaches **Hot** status (70+ score):
1. AI sends: *"Thanks for all the info! A team member will reach out shortly to help you. 🎉"*
2. Tag **"Hot Lead"** is added automatically
3. Tag **"AI Assistant: OFF"** is added (AI stops)
4. **You get notified** via GHL automation

## 👀 Part 3: Monitoring Conversations

### Where to See AI Activity

**In GHL:**
1. Go to Conversations
2. Filter by tag: "AI Assistant: ON"
3. You'll see the full SMS thread

**What Good Looks Like:**
```
AI: Hey! Quick question - what's your budget range looking like?
Lead: Around $400k
AI: Got it. Which neighborhoods are you eyeing?
Lead: Hyde Park area
AI: Perfect. How many bedrooms do you need?
Lead: 3 bedrooms minimum
```

**What to Watch For:**
```
AI: What's your budget range?
Lead: I'm not interested, stop texting me
```
☝️ **Action:** Add tag "AI Assistant: OFF" immediately

## 🚨 Part 4: When to Step In

### Immediate Intervention Needed:

**Situation 1: Lead is Frustrated**
- Signs: "Stop texting", "Not interested", "Why are you asking so many questions?"
- **Action:** Turn AI off, apologize personally, offer human help

**Situation 2: Lead Has Complex Question**
- Signs: "What's the HOA fee?", "Can I see this property tomorrow?"
- **Action:** AI can't answer these - step in manually

**Situation 3: Lead Scored Hot But Seems Cold**
- Signs: Short answers, no enthusiasm, score doesn't match vibe
- **Action:** Review conversation, adjust your approach

**Situation 4: AI Got Stuck**
- Signs: Same question repeated, no progress after 5+ messages
- **Action:** Turn AI off, start fresh conversation manually

## 📊 Part 6: Best Practices

### Do's ✅

✅ **Trust the scoring** - If AI says Hot, they're ready for you  
✅ **Personalize the handoff** - Reference what they told the AI

### Don'ts ❌

❌ **Don't leave AI on for hot leads** - They want YOU now  
❌ **Don't ignore stuck conversations** - Check weekly for no-replies  
❌ **Don't use AI for VIP leads** - Important clients get human touch immediately  
❌ **Don't skip monitoring** - AI is good but not perfect  
❌ **Don't forget to customize** - Adjust tone/questions as you learn

## 💡 Pro Tips from Jorge

### Tip 1: Batch Process Tags
Monday morning, review weekend leads and bulk-add "AI Assistant: ON" to anyone who responded positively.

### Tip 2: Create Quick Replies
Set up GHL snippets for common human interventions:
- "Hey [name], switching you to me personally. What questions do you have?"
- "Thanks for chatting with our AI! I'm Jorge, let's get you in that home."

### Tip 3: Track Your Time Savings
Before AI: 30 min per lead qualification  
After AI: 5 min per HOT lead (AI pre-qualified)  
**Savings: 25 min × 20 leads/week = 8+ hours saved!**

### Tip 4: Use the Demo for Sales
Show clients your Streamlit dashboard during presentations. It makes you look like a tech-forward agency.
