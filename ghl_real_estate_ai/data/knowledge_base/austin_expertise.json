    "price_concerns": {
      "objection": "Austin seems expensive for Texas",
      "response": "You're right that Austin is premium for Texas, but compared to San Francisco, Seattle, or New York, you'll get significantly more space and amenities for your investment. Plus, Texas has no state income tax, which effectively increases your take-home pay by 5-10%."
    },
    "commute_concerns": {
      "objection": "I'm worried about Texas traffic and commute times",
      "response": "Austin's traffic is real, but the tech corridor is designed to minimize commutes. Apple employees in Round Rock often bike to work, and most major employers offer shuttle services. Plus, Austin's growth is planned around mixed-use development to reduce car dependence."

      "objection": "I've heard mixed things about Texas schools",
      "response": "Austin area has some of the best school districts in Texas - Round Rock ISD and Westlake consistently rank in the top 1% nationally. Many families relocate here specifically for the schools. The education quality rivals anywhere you're coming from."

    "culture_concerns": {
      "objection": "Will we fit into Texas culture coming from [liberal city]?",
      "response": "Austin is 'Keep Austin Weird' for a reason - it's the most progressive city in Texas and feels more like Portland or San Francisco than Dallas. The tech community here is diverse, inclusive, and globally minded. You'll find your tribe."
    },
    "timing_concerns": {
      "objection": "The market seems too hot to buy right now",
      "response": "Austin's growth is structural, not speculative. Apple, Google, Meta, and Tesla are making billion-dollar, long-term commitments here. Waiting means paying more later and missing the appreciation that comes with this unprecedented growth phase."
