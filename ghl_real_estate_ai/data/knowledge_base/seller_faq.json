      "question": "How do you calculate your offer price?",
      "answer": "We look at the recent sales of similar homes in your neighborhood (comps), the current condition of your property, and the cost of any needed repairs. Our goal is to provide a fair, data-driven offer that reflects the market value while accounting for the convenience of a fast, as-is sale.",

      "question": "How fast can you close?",
      "answer": "We can typically close in as little as 7 to 14 days, depending on your needs. Since we use private funds and don't rely on traditional bank financing, we can move much faster than a standard buyer. If you need more time, we can also schedule the closing for a date that works best for you.",

      "answer": "Not at all. We buy houses in 'as-is' condition. You don't need to paint, repair the roof, or even clean out the closets. You can take what you want and leave the rest behind—we'll handle everything from there.",

      "question": "Are there any commissions or hidden fees?",
      "answer": "No. When you sell to us, there are no real estate agent commissions (which typically save you 6%) and we usually cover all standard closing costs. The offer we give you is the amount you'll walk away with at the closing table.",
