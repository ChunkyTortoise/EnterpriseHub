      "question": "What credit score do I need to buy a house?",
      "answer": "For conventional loans, you typically need a minimum credit score of 620. FHA loans are more flexible and accept scores as low as 580 (or even 500 with a larger down payment). The higher your score, the better your interest rate. If you're below 620, I recommend working with a credit repair specialist for 3-6 months before applying.",

      "question": "How much do I need for a down payment?",
      "answer": "It depends on your loan type. FHA loans require as little as 3.5% down. Conventional loans typically need 5-20% (putting down 20% avoids PMI insurance). VA loans for veterans require $0 down. For a $400k home, that's $14k (FHA), $20k-80k (conventional), or $0 (VA). First-time buyers often qualify for assistance programs that can cover $5k-15k of your down payment.",

      "question": "What is PMI and can I avoid it?",
      "answer": "PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) is required on conventional loans when you put down less than 20%. It costs $50-200/month depending on your loan amount. You can avoid it by: (1) putting 20% down, (2) getting a piggyback loan (80-10-10 structure), or (3) using an FHA loan (which has MIP instead, but lower upfront cost). PMI automatically drops off once you reach 20% equity.",

      "question": "How long does it take to close on a house?",
      "answer": "Typical timeline is 30-45 days from offer acceptance to closing. Cash buyers can close in 7-14 days. The process includes: inspection (7-10 days), appraisal (10-14 days), underwriting (10-20 days), and final walkthrough. Delays happen if there are repair negotiations or appraisal issues. Pre-approval speeds things up significantly.",

      "question": "What is the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval?",
      "answer": "Pre-qualification is a quick estimate based on self-reported info (takes 1 day, not verified). Pre-approval is a full underwriting where the lender verifies your income, credit, and assets (takes 3-5 days). Sellers take pre-approved buyers seriously because they're 90% guaranteed to close. I always recommend getting pre-approved before house hunting—it gives you negotiating power.",

      "question": "Should I waive the inspection to make my offer stronger?",
      "answer": "I strongly advise against waiving inspections, even in competitive markets. Instead, shorten the inspection period (5 days instead of 10) or offer an 'inspection for information only' clause (you'll still inspect but won't ask for repairs). Major issues like foundation problems or mold can cost $20k-100k to fix. A $400-600 inspection protects you from buying a money pit.",

      "question": "How much should I offer below asking price?",
      "answer": "It depends on market conditions. In hot markets (like Austin), homes often sell at or above asking. In buyer's markets, 5-10% below asking is reasonable. I analyze comparable sales (comps) to determine fair value. If a home is priced at $400k but comps show $380k, we'd offer $375k-385k. Days on market also matter—if it's been listed 60+ days, sellers are more motivated.",

      "question": "What are closing costs and how much are they?",
      "answer": "Closing costs are fees paid at closing (separate from down payment). They're typically 2-5% of the purchase price. For a $400k home, expect $8k-20k. This includes: loan origination ($1k-2k), appraisal ($500-700), title insurance ($1k-2k), escrow/attorney fees ($500-1k), property taxes (prorated), and recording fees ($200-500). You can ask the seller to cover some closing costs in your offer.",

      "question": "How do I price my home to sell quickly?",
      "answer": "Price it at or slightly below market value based on recent comps. Overpricing by even 5% can cause your home to sit for months (then you'll need to drop the price, which makes buyers suspicious). I run a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) looking at 3-5 similar homes sold in the last 90 days. Homes priced right sell within 2 weeks and often get multiple offers, driving the price up naturally.",

      "answer": "Focus on high-ROI fixes: fresh paint ($500 returns $2k), deep cleaning ($200 returns $1k), landscaping ($300 returns $1.5k), and minor repairs (leaky faucets, broken fixtures). Don't renovate kitchens or bathrooms unless they're severely outdated—you won't recoup the cost. Buyers expect some wear and tear. Big issues (roof, HVAC, foundation) can be disclosed and priced accordingly.",

      "answer": "Trying to time the market is risky. If you're financially ready (stable income, 6-month emergency fund, pre-approved), buy when you find the right home. Waiting for rates or prices to drop can backfire—Austin's median home price has risen 8% annually over the past decade. Even if prices dip 5%, rising interest rates could cost you more monthly. Real estate is a long-term investment (7+ years).",

      "question": "How do rising interest rates affect my buying power?",
      "answer": "Every 1% increase in interest rates costs you ~$200/month per $300k borrowed. At 4% on $400k loan = $1,910/month. At 6% = $2,398/month. That's $488/month or $175k over 30 years. This is why pre-approval is critical—lock in your rate for 60-90 days. If rates are rising, consider paying points (1 point = 1% of loan amount) to lower your rate by 0.25%.",

Best areas: East Austin ($350k-500k condos, 7% cap rate), Pflugerville (SFH $300k-400k, rent $2k-2.5k/month), Leander (newer builds, $350k-450k). Vacancy rates are <5%. If you can hold 10+ years, Austin's population growth (+3% annually) drives long-term appreciation.",

Attorney review costs $500-1,500 but can save you from $10k+ mistakes. For standard transactions, your agent and title company provide adequate protection.",

They DON'T check: cosmetic issues, appliances (unless specified), pest damage (separate inspection). Expect a 30-50 page report.

Example: Offer $400k, appraisal $385k. Gap = $15k. If putting 10% down, you'd need $40k + $15k = $55k total. Smart move: Include appraisal contingency in your offer to protect yourself.",

Travis County is slightly higher (2.2%), Williamson County slightly lower (2.0%). Homestead exemption saves ~$300-500/year. Over-65 exemption adds more savings.

Buying first = seamless move, but you'll carry 2 mortgages temporarily. Middle ground: Home sale contingency (offer on new home contingent on selling yours—sellers don't love this). Or bridge loan (borrow against current home equity for down payment, pay off when it sells). I can connect you with lenders who specialize in bridge loans.",
