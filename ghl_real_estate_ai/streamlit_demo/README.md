## How It Works

1. **User sends message** → Chat interface
2. **MockClaude extracts data** → Budget, location, timeline, etc.
3. **LeadScorer calculates score** → Uses actual production scorer
4. **Tags auto-applied** → Based on score + preferences
5. **MockRAG searches properties** → Matches from knowledge base
6. **Dashboard updates** → Real-time visualization

## Deployment

### Streamlit Cloud

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io
3. Connect repository
4. Select `streamlit_demo/app.py` as main file
5. Deploy!

### Environment Variables

No API keys needed for demo - fully self-contained.

## Production Integration

This demo uses:
- **Real LeadScorer**: Production-grade scoring algorithm
- **Real Property Data**: Actual listings from knowledge base
- **Mock API**: Simulated Claude responses (replace with real API for production)

To convert to production:
1. Replace `MockClaudeService` with real Anthropic API calls
2. Connect to live CRM (GHL API)
3. Deploy backend API
4. Update property data source

## Testing

All components tested and verified:
- ✅ Mock services work correctly
- ✅ Lead scorer integration successful
- ✅ Property matching accurate
- ✅ UI renders properly
- ✅ State management functional
