## 📋 **JORGE PITCH STRATEGY**

### **🎯 Email Approach**

```
Subject: Partnership Opportunity - Realistic Budget, Real Results

Hi Jorge,

I've been researching lyrio.io and I'm impressed with what you've built. I see significant opportunities to enhance your platform with AI capabilities that could 2-3x your customer value.

I've developed a comprehensive real estate AI platform worth $362K+ in automation value. Instead of a large consulting engagement, I'd like to propose a partnership approach:

• Small project-based work ($1,500-5,000 per project)
• Equity participation (4-6%) for long-term alignment
• Sales commissions to help grow your revenue
• No large upfront costs or retainer requirements

I can demonstrate the platform capabilities that show $136K+ commission capture scenarios for real estate agents. Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore how we might work together?

I think you'll find the approach uniquely structured for your business size and growth goals.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
