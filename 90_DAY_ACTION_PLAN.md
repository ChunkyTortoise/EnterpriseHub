Solution:
- Review what's working in your outreach (look at response patterns)
- Update messaging based on feedback

- Use analytics to see where prospects are bouncing

Roadblock: "Can't close Founding Client deals"
Solution:

- Make commitment minimal (3-month pilot instead of 6-month)
- Start with smaller projects to build trust
