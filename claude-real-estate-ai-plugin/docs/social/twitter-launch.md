## Main Launch Thread

### Tweet 1: Hook (Main Tweet)
```
🚀 I just shipped a Claude Code plugin that cuts real estate AI development time by 83%.

After 3 months and 147 features in production, here's what I learned about building with Claude Code—and why it changed everything 🧵

```

**Engagement tactics**:
- Opens with bold claim (83% time savings)
- Proof upfront (147 features, 3 months)
- Promise of insights (what I learned)
- Visual hook (GIF)
- Thread emoji signals more content

---

### Tweet 2: The Problem
```
Building real estate AI is brutal:

❌ 6 hours writing tests from scratch
❌ 8 hours on GHL webhook handlers
❌ 4 hours debugging race conditions
❌ 3 hours figuring out deployments

Every feature = weeks of grind.

There had to be a better way.
```

**Strategy**: Pain points that resonate with target audience

---

### Tweet 3: The Solution
```
Enter: Claude Real Estate AI Accelerator

27 production-grade skills that handle:
✅ TDD workflows (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR)
✅ GHL integrations (webhooks, sync, pipelines)
✅ Streamlit UIs (design systems, components)
✅ Multi-agent coordination
✅ Cost optimization

All from prompts.
```

**Strategy**: Solution positioned as direct antidote to pain points

---

### Tweet 4: Proof (Screenshot)
```
Real example: Property matcher with TDD

Before plugin: 6+ hours
With plugin: 4 minutes

[Screenshot: VS Code showing TDD workflow completion with 94% coverage]

This isn't theory. This is production code running on 50+ real estate platforms.
```

**Strategy**: Social proof with specific numbers and visual evidence

---

### Tweet 5: How It Works
```
The magic? Skills that encode expertise.

Instead of googling "how to handle Redis race conditions" for the 10th time...

Just prompt:
"Create lead scorer with TDD and Redis caching"

The skill knows:
• Double-checked locking
• Graceful degradation
• Performance benchmarks
• Edge cases
```

**Strategy**: Explain the "how" to build credibility

---

### Tweet 6: Real Metrics
```
3 months of production data:

📊 Time Savings:
• TDD setup: 83%
• UI components: 88%
• API endpoints: 80%
• Deployments: 75%

🎯 Quality:
• 147 features shipped
• 94% test coverage
• 0 critical bugs

This isn't a demo. This is how we ship.
```

**Strategy**: Overwhelming evidence with real metrics

---

### Tweet 7: Specific Use Case
```
Example: Building a lead scoring system

Skill handles:
✅ Weighted score calculation
✅ Redis caching (60s TTL)
✅ Race condition prevention
✅ Async/await patterns
✅ Error handling
✅ Performance tests (< 100ms)
✅ 96% coverage

From prompt to production: 12 minutes.
```

**Strategy**: Concrete example readers can visualize

---

### Tweet 8: Cost Savings
```
Bonus: Built-in cost optimization skill

Analyzes your token usage and suggests:
• Model switching (Haiku vs Sonnet)
• Caching strategies
• Batch operations

Result: 40% cost reduction for most projects

[Screenshot: Cost optimization analysis showing $38/month savings]
```

**Strategy**: Additional value proposition (save money + time)

### The Comparison Tweet
```
Building a GHL webhook handler:

Without plugin:
- 8 hours research
- 4 hours coding
- 2 hours debugging
- 1 hour testing
━━━━━━━━━━
Total: 15 hours

With plugin:
- 1 prompt
- 8 minutes
━━━━━━━━━━
Total: 8 minutes

This is why plugins matter.

### The "I Wish I Knew" Tweet
```
I wish I knew about Claude Code plugins 6 months ago.

3 things I'd do differently:
1. [Specific example]
2. [Specific example]
3. [Specific example]

The time I'd have saved: 200+ hours

What's your biggest time sink in real estate AI development?
```

---

### The Controversial Take
```
Hot take: If you're still writing boilerplate tests manually in 2026, you're wasting 80% of your development time.

TDD should be:
1. Describe what you want
2. Watch tests get generated
3. Review and approve

That's it.

The plugin does #2 better than I can do manually.

Fight me 👇
