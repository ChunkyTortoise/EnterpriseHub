## 🗣️ What Developers Are Saying

> "I was skeptical about the 83% time savings claim. After using it for a month, I'm a believer. Built an entire property matching system in 3 days that would have taken me 3 weeks. The GHL integration patterns alone are worth 10x the price."
>
> **— Sarah Chen, Lead Developer at PropTech Innovations**

---

> "The multi-agent orchestration is a game-changer. I can now coordinate security reviews, performance testing, and code quality checks in parallel while I focus on business logic. Shipped 5 features last week that would have taken a month before."
>
> **— Marcus Johnson, Founder at RealEstateAI.dev**

---

> "As a solo developer building a real estate SaaS, this plugin is like having a senior engineering team. The TDD workflows prevented 3 critical bugs that would have made it to production. ROI was positive within the first week."
>
> **— Emily Rodriguez, Indie Hacker**

---

> "We're a 12-person agency building custom real estate platforms. This plugin standardized our development process across the team. Code review time dropped by 60% because everyone follows the same patterns. Documentation is outstanding."
>
> **— David Park, CTO at HomeTech Solutions**
