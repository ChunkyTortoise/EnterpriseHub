# AI DevOps Suite

## Headline

**AI DevOps Monitoring + Prompt Registry + Data Pipeline -- One Platform**

Monitor your AI agents, version your prompts with A/B testing, and run automated data pipelines -- all from a unified FastAPI + Streamlit stack.

---

## Value Proposition

AI teams waste weeks stitching together monitoring, prompt management, and data ingestion. This suite gives you all three with P50/P95/P99 metrics, git-like prompt versioning with statistical A/B testing, and scheduled scraping pipelines -- 123 tests, Docker-ready.

## Features

### Agent Monitoring
- **Telemetry collection**: Track latency, token usage, errors per agent
- **P50/P95/P99 metrics**: Real-time percentile calculations
- **Anomaly detection**: Statistical outlier identification
- **Alerting**: Configurable rules with cooldown periods

### Prompt Registry
- **Git-like versioning**: Branch, tag, and rollback prompts
- **A/B testing**: Statistical significance via z-test
- **Safety validation**: Injection detection, PII scanning
- **Approval workflows**: Review before production deployment

### Data Pipeline
- **Web scraping**: httpx + BeautifulSoup with retry logic
- **Scheduled jobs**: APScheduler integration
- **LLM extraction**: Structured data extraction from unstructured sources
- **Pipeline orchestration**: DAG-based execution

### BI Dashboard
- **Streamlit-powered**: Real-time metrics visualization
- **Agent performance**: Latency trends, error rates, cost tracking
- **Prompt analytics**: A/B test results, version history
