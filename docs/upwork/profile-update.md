# Upwork Profile Update

## Title

**Senior AI Engineer | RAG Systems, Multi-Agent Orchestration, Voice AI, GoHighLevel | 8,500+ Tests**

---

## Overview

I build production AI infrastructure that ships with tests, documentation, and Docker deployment. Not prototypes -- production systems.

**What I deliver:**

- **RAG Systems**: Multi-tenant document Q&A with pgvector hybrid search, PII detection, and Stripe metered billing. 120+ tests per implementation.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Agent coordination with 4.3M tool dispatches/sec, cross-agent handoff, and real-time monitoring. Used in production managing $50M+ pipeline.
- **Voice AI**: Real-time voice agents via Twilio + Deepgram + ElevenLabs + Claude. Lead qualification, appointment booking, CRM sync.
- **GoHighLevel Integration**: Custom field mapping, workflow triggers, calendar booking, contact tagging, cross-bot handoff -- all via GHL API.
- **LLM Cost Optimization**: 3-tier Redis caching that achieved 89% cost reduction (88% cache hit rate, verified).

**My track record:**

- 11 production repositories with 8,500+ automated tests, all CI green
- 33 Architecture Decision Records documenting engineering tradeoffs
- Benchmark suites with P50/P95/P99 metrics in every repo
- Docker deployment across all repos (Dockerfile + docker-compose)
- 3 CRM integrations (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce) via unified protocol
- MCP Server Toolkit published on PyPI

**How I work:**

- TDD-first: I write failing tests before implementation
- Over-documented: Architecture diagrams, ADRs, runbooks
- Async communication: Daily progress updates, no surprises
- Full delivery: Code + tests + docs + deployment + training

## Specializations

### Specialized Profile 1: RAG & Document AI

**Title**: RAG Systems Engineer | pgvector, Hybrid Search, Multi-Tenant Architecture

I design and build Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems for production use. My RAG implementations include hybrid search (semantic + BM25 with RRF fusion), query expansion (HyDE, multi-query), PII detection, and multi-tenant isolation.

Key project: Multi-tenant RAG-as-a-Service platform with 120 tests, Stripe metered billing, and 89% LLM cost reduction via caching.

### Specialized Profile 2: AI Agent Development

**Title**: Multi-Agent Systems Engineer | Orchestration, Voice AI, CRM Integration

I build multi-agent AI systems with coordination, handoff, monitoring, and CRM integration. Specialties include voice AI (Twilio/Deepgram/ElevenLabs), GoHighLevel automation, and agent fleet monitoring.

Key project: Real estate AI platform with 3 specialized bots, 5,100+ tests, managing $50M+ pipeline.
