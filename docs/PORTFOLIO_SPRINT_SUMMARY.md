## Risks & Mitigations

---

### Risk: ZIP Package Creation Time

**Impact**: 21 ZIP files to create (7 products x 3 tiers)
**Mitigation**: Automate with script, batch process
**Timeline**: 1-2 hours one-time

---

### Risk: Cold Email Bounce/Spam

**Mitigation**: Use templates, personalize, low volume (10/batch)
**Timeline**: Monitor first batch, adjust templates

---

### Risk: Fiverr Competition

**Impact**: 1000s of competing gigs
**Mitigation**: Premium positioning, portfolio examples, verified metrics
**Timeline**: Stand out with production quality proof

## Team Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Parallel Agent Execution**: 5 agents working simultaneously delivered 8 tasks in ~2 hours
2. **Specialized Roles**: Each agent focused on their domain expertise
3. **Clear Task Ownership**: No overlap or duplication of work
4. **Comprehensive Deliverables**: Production-ready, not drafts

### Areas for Improvement

1. **File Location Clarity**: Some agents created files in unexpected directories
2. **Manual Action Handoff**: Better documentation of browser-required tasks
3. **Dependency Management**: Clearer blocking relationships between tasks

### Recommendations for Future Sprints

1. **Pre-define file paths** in task descriptions
2. **Separate research from execution** tasks more explicitly
3. **Use sub-agents for validation** (e.g., quality-gate for deliverables)
4. **Implement progress check-ins** at 50% completion
