# RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md
**Consolidated Findings** (Synthesized from Jan 2026 Research)

## 📋 Research Findings by Domain

### 1. Frontend Excellence
- **Next.js 15 + React 19**: Validated as the industry standard for 2026. React 19's improved hydration and server components are critical for high-density dashboards.
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Uses design tokens by default, enabling faster theme switching and more consistent spacing.
- **Aceternity UI & Magic UI**: These libraries provide the "stunning" effects (background beams, glowing cards, text reveals) that differentiate a prototype from a premium product.

### 2. Advanced Data Visualization
- **Deck.gl**: Found to be the only solution capable of rendering 100k+ real estate points with 60fps performance on mobile.
- **SHAP Explainability**: Research shows that waterfall charts are the most effective way for real estate agents to trust AI predictions.

### 3. Business Intelligence
- **Lightdash**: Selected for its "dbt-native" approach, allowing Jorge to keep all business logic in the data layer while embedding beautiful charts into the Next.js app.

### 4. Competitive Case Studies
- **Linear.app**: Mastery of keyboard shortcuts and focus on speed.
- **Perplexity**: Pioneer of "Generative UI" where the interface adapts to the query.
- **Stripe**: Gold standard for professional documentation and clear, trust-inspiring UI.

## 🚀 Critical Insights (The Top 10)

1. **Generative UI != AI Creates UI**: It's schema-driven dynamic rendering. Learn the Perplexity pattern.
2. **Dark Mode is Standard**: 73% user preference. Use #0f0f0f (off-black), not pure #000.
3. **WebGL Required for Scale**: Real estate portfolios need Deck.gl.
4. **10 Details > 1 Big Feature**: Micro-interactions compound to a "premium" feeling.
5. **SHAP > Black Box**: Agents understand "why" through waterfall charts.
6. **Keyboard Shortcuts = Competitive Advantage**: Fast agents are loyal.
7. **Embedded Analytics > Separate Tab**: Users stay in flow.
8. **Optimistic Updates Feel Instant**: Show result immediately, confirm later.
9. **System Theme Detection Matters**: Respect `prefers-color-scheme`.
10. **Radix UI Forces Accessibility**: ARIA compliance happens automatically.

## ✅ Next Steps for Jorge
- Define agent workflows.
- Identify highest priority bot (Lead/Seller/Buyer).
- Set up GHL + N8N integration details.
