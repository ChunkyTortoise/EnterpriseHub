## 🛠️ The Expansion Phases

### Phase 2: Smart Property Matching (The "Precision Search")
**Goal:** Automate the manual task of finding homes for leads.
- **AI Matching:** Cross-references buyer criteria (budget, beds, location) directly against your current inventory.
- **SMS Delivery:** Automatically sends curated listing links to hot leads via GHL.
- **Inventory Management:** Easy upload tool for new listings to keep the AI updated.
- **Timeframe:** 7 Days
- **Investment:** **$1,500**

### Phase 3: Self-Service Buyer Portal (The "Mobile App Experience")
**Goal:** Give leads a premium, branded place to manage their search.
- **Personalized Links:** Every lead gets a unique URL (e.g., `portal.jorgesalas.ai/l/michael`).
- **Real-Time Profile Sync:** Leads adjust their own budget/criteria; GHL custom fields update instantly.
- **Engagement Tracking:** See which properties they "save" or "like" in real-time.
- **Timeframe:** 7 Days (Concurrent)
- **Investment:** **$2,200**

### Phase 4: Intelligent Follow-Up (The "Never-Cold Engine")
**Goal:** Lifecycle automation that re-engages leads without you lifting a finger.
- **New Listing Alerts:** AI texts leads the moment a new home matches their saved search.
- **Price Drop Triggers:** Auto-re-engage leads if a property they liked drops in price.
- **Silent Lead Recovery:** Conversational bots that "check in" at 24h, 48h, and 72h intervals.
- **Timeframe:** 5 Days
- **Investment:** **$950**
