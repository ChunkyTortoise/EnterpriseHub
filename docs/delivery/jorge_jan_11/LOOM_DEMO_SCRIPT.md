# 🎥 Loom Demo Script: GHL Conversion Engine Walkthrough

**Goal:** Show Jorge (and his future clients) the "Wow" factor of the 8-Hub system.

### 1. The Hook (0:00 - 0:45)
"Hey Jorge! I wanted to give you a quick walkthrough of the **Conversion Engine** we’ve built for your GHL account. We’ve moved beyond a simple bot—this is a full-scale Business Intelligence platform that qualifies, scores, and matches leads for you 24/7."

### 2. The AI Brain (0:45 - 2:00)
"First, let's look at the **Lead Intelligence Hub**. This is where the AI does the heavy lifting. You'll notice it’s using your specific 'Direct & Curious' tone. It doesn't just chat—it extracts 7 key data points (Budget, Location, Timeline, etc.). 
*Highlight:* Once a lead answers 3+ questions, the AI automatically tags them as a **HOT LEAD** in GHL and triggers the booking flow."

### 3. The Matchmaker (2:00 - 3:30)
"This is the game-changer. In the **Sellers Hub**, we've ingested your inventory. The AI now 'knows' your listings. When a buyer says they want a 3-bed in Rancho for under $600k, the AI cross-references that *instantly* and sends them a text with a 'Fit Score' and a reason WHY it picked that home for them."

### 4. The Buyer Portal (3:30 - 4:30)
"This is what the lead sees on their phone. It’s a branded, app-like portal. They can request a tour with one click, which syncs to your GHL calendar. If they update their budget here, it updates your CRM custom fields automatically. No data entry for you."

### 5. The Nurture & Closing (4:30 - 5:00)
"Finally, we have the **'Never-Cold' Nurture**. If a lead ghosts you, the AI wakes up at 24 and 48 hours with those 'break-up' texts we discussed. It’s designed to ensure you never lose a lead to silence again. 

I'm excited to get this live in your account today at 6 PM. Talk soon!"
