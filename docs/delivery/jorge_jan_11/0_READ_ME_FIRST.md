Welcome, Jorge! This folder contains everything we discussed for the **GHL Real Estate AI Conversion Engine** launch.

### 📂 File Guide:

2.  **`TECHNICAL_READINESS_REPORT.md`**: A technical audit of your system. It proves the '8-Hub' architecture is live and that your specific lead scoring logic is working perfectly in the code.
3.  **`SESSION_HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md`**: A quick bulleted summary of today's progress and exactly what was delivered.
4.  **`GHL_SNAPSHOT_BLUEPRINT.md`**: Your guide to scaling. Follow this to set up new clients in GHL in under 60 seconds.
5.  **`LOOM_DEMO_SCRIPT.md`**: Use this script to record a demo video. It’s designed to 'wow' your potential clients by showing the value of the 522+ tests and the AI's matching logic.
6.  **`INVOICE_PHASE_3_TEMPLATE.txt`**: The kickoff invoice for our next phase: **The Buyer Portal**.

### 🚀 Next Steps:
- Review the **Contract** and the **Technical Readiness Report**.
- We will meet at **6:00 PM** for the live walkthrough and to hand over the keys to your Railway production environment.

Looking forward to it!
