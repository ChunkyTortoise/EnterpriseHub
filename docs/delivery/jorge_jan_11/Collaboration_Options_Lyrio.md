# Proposal for Collaboration: Jorge Sales / Lyrio.io

## Executive Summary
**Goal:** To accelerate Lyrio.io's technical roadmap by injecting senior engineering capability where it drives the most revenue, without the overhead of a full-time hire.
**My Role:** I act as a "Technical Force Multiplier." I don't just configure settings; I build the custom code, integrations, and AI logic that differentiate Lyrio from generic CRMs.

## Engagement Models

I have outlined three ways we can work together. My goal is to give you flexibility while ensuring my incentives are aligned with Lyrio's success.

### Option 0: The "Diagnostic" (Entry Point)
*Best for: Understanding where you are losing money/leads before committing to a build.*

**How it works:**
I perform a deep-dive technical audit of your current GoHighLevel setup and AI workflows. I look for API bottlenecks, "leaky" automations, and opportunities to cut costs (e.g., optimizing LLM token usage).

*   **Deliverable:** A prioritized "Technical Roadmap" PDF outlining exactly what to fix and build.
*   **Price:** **$250 flat fee**. (Credited back if you hire me for Option 1).

### Option 1: The "Sniper" (Project-Based)
*Best for: Specific, high-impact features or integrations.*

**How it works:**
We identify a specific pain point or feature. I quote a fixed price for the deliverable. You pay for the **result**, not the hours.

*   **Structure:** Fixed Price per Project.
*   **Pricing Examples:**
    *   **"Smart" Lead Scorer Middleware:** (e.g., A custom script that analyzes GHL conversation history to tag leads as "Hot/Cold" based on sentiment, not just clicks) - **$750 - $1,200**.
    *   **MLS Property Matcher:** (e.g., An automation that pulls specific MLS data and texts it to leads based on their preferences) - **$1,500 - $3,000**.
    *   **Salesperson Performance Dashboard:** (e.g., A custom view to see exactly which agents are dropping the ball on leads) - **$800 - $1,500**.

**Risk Reversal:**
*   **100% Satisfaction Guarantee:** For our first "Sniper" project (under $1,000), if you aren't thrilled with the code and the result, you don't pay.

**Why this works for you:**
*   Zero risk of "hourly bloat." You know exactly what it costs.
*   Perfect for testing our working relationship.

### Option 2: The "Growth Partner" (Hybrid Retainer + Rev Share)
*Best for: Ongoing optimization, stability, and "owning" a vertical.*

**How it works:**
I dedicate a set block of availability each month to ensure the system is humming and to implement upgrades. In exchange for a lower base rate, I participate in the upside I help create.

*   **Structure:** Monthly Base + Performance Bonus.
*   **Base Fee:** **$2,500 / month** (Includes up to ~40 hours of priority engineering time).
*   **Performance Bonus:**
    *   *Example:* 10% of 1st-year revenue from *new* features I build.
    *   *Example:* 20% of cost savings realized (e.g., if I optimize LLM token usage and save the company $1k/mo, I get $200/mo of that savings).

**Why this works for you:**
*   Guarantees you have a Senior Engineer "on call."
*   Aligns my brain with your bank account—I only win big if Lyrio wins big.

### Option 3: The "Technical Co-Pilot" (Equity Focused)
*Best for: Long-term vision and major platform evolution.*

**How it works:**
I come on as a fractional technical lead. My cash requirements are minimal, intended only to cover opportunity cost, with the bulk of compensation in equity/vested interest.

*   **Structure:** Low Retainer + Equity/Profit Share.
*   **Base Fee:** **$1,000 / month** (Retainer for availability).
*   **Equity/Comp:**
    *   **Advisory Shares:** Vesting schedule (e.g., 0.5% - 2.0% over 2 years).
    *   **Profit Sharing:** Quarterly payout based on net profit (e.g., 2-5%).

**Why this works for you:**
*   Lowest immediate cash burn.
*   You get a partner who is thinking about the company's valuation 3 years from now, not just next week's code.

## Recommended Next Step
Let's start with **Option 1 (The Sniper)**.

I propose we pick **one specific technical bottleneck** you are facing right now (e.g., a buggy integration, a slow API response, or a feature clients are screaming for).

1.  We define the scope.
2.  I give you a fixed quote (likely between $500 - $1,500).
3.  I deliver it.

If you love the work, we can transition to Option 2 or 3.
