## Case Study 1: Pacific Coast Realty — Eliminating Lead Loss Through Instant Qualification

### Client Profile

**Pacific Coast Realty** is a mid-sized brokerage serving the Southern California market with 45 agents across three offices in Rancho Cucamonga, Ontario, and Upland. Specializing in residential properties ranging from $500K to $2M+, the brokerage generates approximately 800-1,000 leads per month through Zillow, Realtor.com, and their website.

**Key Metrics Before EnterpriseHub:**
- Monthly lead volume: 850 leads
- Average response time: 47 minutes
- Lead qualification rate: 23%
- Conversion to appointment: 8.5%
- Monthly revenue from new leads: $127,500

### The Challenge

Pacific Coast Realty was losing approximately 40% of their incoming leads due to slow response times. With agents juggling showings, paperwork, and client meetings, most leads weren't contacted within the critical 5-minute window. The brokerage's manual qualification process was inconsistent—some agents followed up immediately, while others took hours or even days.

"We were generating great leads, but we couldn't respond fast enough," explains Sarah Martinez, Broker-Owner. "By the time our agents got to a new inquiry, the prospect had already moved on to another agent. We were essentially paying for leads that our competitors were closing."

The brokerage tried hiring additional support staff to handle initial lead contact, but this increased overhead by $8,500/month without significantly improving conversion rates. The manual qualification process was also prone to human error—inconsistent questioning, missed follow-ups, and poor documentation in their CRM.

### The Solution

Pacific Coast Realty implemented EnterpriseHub in January 2026, deploying all three AI bots to create a comprehensive lead qualification and nurturing system:

**1. Jorge Lead Bot — First Response & Initial Qualification**
- Automatically responds to all new leads within 30 seconds
- Uses the Q0-Q4 qualification framework to assess lead quality
- Scores leads 1-10 and tags them as Hot, Warm, or Cold
- Routes high-scoring leads (8+) directly to agents via SMS notification

**2. Jorge Buyer Bot — Property Matching & Education**
- Engages qualified buyer leads with personalized property recommendations
- Provides market insights and neighborhood information
- Schedules property showings based on agent availability
- Maintains engagement through automated follow-up sequences

**3. Jorge Seller Bot — Listing Consultation Prep**
- Conducts preliminary seller qualification (motivation, timeline, pricing expectations)
- Gathers property details and prepares preliminary CMA data
- Schedules listing appointments with qualified sellers
- Provides market education to set realistic expectations

**Integration with GoHighLevel CRM:**
- All bot interactions automatically sync to the CRM
- Lead scores and tags update in real-time
- Automated task creation for agent follow-ups
- Comprehensive conversation history for each contact

**Streamlit BI Dashboard:**
- Real-time visibility into lead flow and bot performance
- Conversion tracking from lead to appointment to closed deal
- Agent performance metrics and leaderboard
- ROI analysis and commission forecasting

### The Results

Within 90 days of implementation, Pacific Coast Realty achieved dramatic improvements across all key metrics:

- Annualized revenue increase: $2,854,800
- Platform investment: $1,200/month

## Case Study 2: Inland Empire Property Group — Data-Driven Growth Through BI Insights

### Client Profile

**Inland Empire Property Group** is a rapidly growing real estate team with 18 agents operating across the Inland Empire region. Founded in 2021, the team has experienced explosive growth, closing $42M in sales volume in 2025. However, this rapid expansion created operational challenges—leadership lacked visibility into team performance, lead sources, and conversion metrics.

**Key Metrics Before EnterpriseHub:**
- Annual sales volume: $42M
- Team size: 18 agents
- Monthly lead volume: 450 leads
- Average commission per transaction: $18,500
- Data management: Spreadsheets, disconnected tools, manual reporting

### The Challenge

As Inland Empire Property Group scaled from 6 to 18 agents in just 18 months, founder Michael Chen found himself drowning in data but starving for insights. The team used multiple disconnected systems—GoHighLevel for CRM, Zillow for leads, spreadsheets for tracking, and various marketing tools. There was no unified view of performance, making it impossible to answer critical business questions:

- Which lead sources produced the highest-quality leads?
- Which agents were converting leads most effectively?
- What was the true cost per acquisition for each marketing channel?
- How were bot interactions impacting conversion rates?
- Where were bottlenecks in the sales pipeline?

"We were flying blind," Chen admits. "We had all this data scattered across different platforms, but no way to make sense of it. We couldn't tell if our marketing spend was effective, which agents needed coaching, or where leads were dropping out of our pipeline. We were making decisions based on gut feelings rather than data."

The team spent approximately 15 hours per week manually compiling reports from various sources, and even then, the reports were outdated by the time they were reviewed. This lack of real-time visibility led to missed opportunities, wasted marketing spend, and inconsistent agent performance.

### The Solution

Inland Empire Property Group implemented EnterpriseHub in November 2025, focusing on the platform's business intelligence capabilities to create a data-driven operation:

- Activity metrics (calls, emails, showings)

**Financial Analytics Dashboard:**

### Client Testimonial

> "EnterpriseHub gave us the visibility we needed to scale intelligently. Before, we were growing but we didn't really understand why some agents succeeded while others struggled. Now we have complete visibility into every aspect of our business—from lead sources to agent performance to financial projections. The dashboards are intuitive and powerful, and the AI insights have helped us identify opportunities we would have missed. We've eliminated wasted marketing spend, improved agent performance through data-driven coaching, and accelerated our growth trajectory.
