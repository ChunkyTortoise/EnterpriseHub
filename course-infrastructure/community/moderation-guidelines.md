# Community Moderation Guidelines

Content moderation policy and escalation process for the Production AI Systems Discord server.

## Code of Conduct

All members of the Production AI Systems community agree to:

1. **Be respectful.** Treat everyone with dignity. No harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, disability, or any other characteristic.

2. **Be constructive.** When giving feedback on code or ideas, focus on the work, not the person. Offer specific, actionable suggestions.

3. **Be honest.** Submit your own work for labs. Collaboration is encouraged, but copying solutions without understanding defeats the purpose. Cite sources and give credit.

4. **Be professional.** This is a learning environment with professional implications. Conduct yourself as you would in a workplace Slack channel.

5. **Protect intellectual property.** Do not share course content (recordings, lab solutions, materials) outside the Discord server. Do not redistribute paid content.

6. **Keep it on-topic.** Use the appropriate channels. Technical questions go in #technical-support or the relevant week channel. Off-topic conversation goes in #off-topic.

7. **No spam or self-promotion.** Do not post unsolicited links to your products, courses, or services. Job postings go in #job-board only and must be verified by staff.

8. **Respect privacy.** Do not share anyone's personal information without their consent. Do not screenshot or share private messages.

## Moderation Policies

### Prohibited Content

The following are strictly prohibited and will result in immediate action:

| Content | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Hate speech, slurs, or discriminatory language | Immediate ban |
| Harassment or targeted personal attacks | Immediate ban |
| NSFW content or sexually explicit material | Immediate ban |
| Malware, phishing, or malicious links | Immediate ban |

| Sharing course content externally | Permanent ban + legal notice |
| Impersonating staff or other members | 7-day ban, permanent on repeat |
| Spam or unsolicited advertising | Delete + warning, ban on repeat |

### Academic Integrity

Lab submissions must represent the student's own work. The following is acceptable:

- Discussing approaches and concepts with peers
- Asking for help debugging specific issues
- Referencing documentation, Stack Overflow, and official guides
- Using AI coding assistants (with understanding of the output)

The following is NOT acceptable:

- Copying another student's lab solution verbatim
- Sharing your complete solution before the lab deadline
- Using automated tools to complete labs without engaging with the material
- Submitting work done entirely by someone else

**Penalty for academic integrity violations:**
1. First offense: Written warning + lab score of 0 (can resubmit)
2. Second offense: Course failure (no certificate), may continue attending sessions
3. Third offense: Removal from course (no refund)

## Escalation Process

### Level 1: Automated (Bot)

MEE6 and Carl-bot handle:
- Invite link removal from non-staff
- Excessive caps warning
- Repeated message detection
- Profanity filter (configurable word list)

**Bot response**: Auto-delete message + DM warning to the user.

### Level 2: Teaching Assistant

TAs handle:
- Off-topic messages in course channels (redirect, not delete)
- Minor disagreements between students
- Clarifying code of conduct questions
- Temporary mutes (up to 1 hour)

**TA actions available**: Delete messages, mute members, create threads, pin messages.

**Response time**: Within 4 hours during weekdays, next business day on weekends.

### Level 3: Instructor Notification

TAs escalate to the instructor when:
- A member has received 3+ warnings
- There is a dispute between members that TAs cannot resolve
- Academic integrity violation is suspected
- Any situation involving potential legal issues

**Instructor actions available**: All of the above + ban, role changes, channel lockdown.

### Level 4: Permanent Action

The instructor takes permanent action for:
- Repeated violations after warnings
- Any bannable offense (see prohibited content table)
- Content redistribution
- Actions that harm the community or course reputation

**Process**:
1. Document the violation with screenshots
2. DM the member explaining the action and reason
3. Execute the ban/removal
4. Post a brief, non-identifying note in #staff-general
5. Update enrollment records (ConvertKit tag: "removed")

## Conflict Resolution

When two or more members have a disagreement:

1. **Encourage self-resolution first.** DM both parties suggesting they take the conversation to DMs and resolve amicably.
2. **Mediate if needed.** If the conflict continues in public channels, a TA moves the discussion to a private thread with both parties.
3. **Instructor decision.** If mediation fails, the instructor makes a final decision. Both parties are informed via DM.
4. **Cooling off.** Both parties may be temporarily muted from each other's threads for 24 hours.

## Reporting

Members can report issues by:

1. **DM a TA or the Instructor** — Preferred for sensitive issues
2. **React with the flag emoji** on the offending message — TAs review flagged messages
3. **Use Discord's built-in Report feature** — For violations of Discord ToS

All reports are treated confidentially. The reporter's identity is never disclosed to the reported member.

## Staff Guidelines

### For Teaching Assistants

- Always assume good intent first. Many violations are from ignorance, not malice.
- DM first, public action second. Give people a chance to correct behavior privately.
- Document everything. Screenshot violations before deleting messages.
- Escalate when unsure. It is better to ask the instructor than to take an action you cannot reverse.
- Be consistent. Apply the same standards to all members regardless of their tier or seniority.

### For the Instructor

- Review #mod-log daily during active cohorts
- Hold a weekly 15-min sync with TAs on community health
- Publish a monthly community health report (anonymized): warnings issued, escalations, member satisfaction
- Update the word filter and bot rules as new patterns emerge
