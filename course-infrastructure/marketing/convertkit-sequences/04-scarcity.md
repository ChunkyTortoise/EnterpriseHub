Hey {first_name},

Quick update: **{enrolled_count} students have enrolled** in Production AI Systems so far, and **{remaining_beta} beta spots remain** at $797.

I wanted to address the questions I've been getting:

**"Is this course right for me if I already know Python but haven't built AI systems?"**

Yes. That's exactly who this is for. You know how to write code — this course teaches you how to architect, test, and deploy AI-specific systems. Things like multi-strategy output parsing, L1/L2/L3 caching for LLM calls, agent-to-agent handoff protocols, and RAG evaluation pipelines.

**"What if I can't make the live sessions?"**

All sessions are recorded and posted within 24 hours. The labs are asynchronous — you can complete them any time during the week. The Discord community is always available for questions. That said, live attendance is where the most learning happens (live Q&A, breakout discussions, real-time debugging).

**"What do I need installed on my machine?"**

A web browser. That's it. Every lab runs in GitHub Codespaces — a cloud development environment that comes pre-configured with Python 3.11, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, and all dependencies. Click a button and you're coding.

**"How much time should I budget per week?"**

Plan for 5-7 hours per week: 3 hours of live sessions + 2-4 hours on the lab assignment. Students with more experience will finish labs faster. Students who want to go deeper can explore the full production repos.

**"What happens after the course?"**

You keep lifetime access to all recordings, lab repositories, and materials. You join the alumni Discord channel where you can continue networking and collaborating. And the 5 products you build are yours — deploy them, add them to your portfolio, or use them as the foundation for a SaaS business.

**"What if it's not what I expected?"**

Full refund within 7 days of course start if you've attended fewer than 2 sessions. No questions asked.

{remaining_beta} beta spots at $797. Once they're gone, enrollment continues at $1,297 (Standard).
