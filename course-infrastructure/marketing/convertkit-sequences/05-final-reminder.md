Hey {first_name},

Enrollment for **Production AI Systems** closes tomorrow at 11:59 PM PT.

I'll keep this short because by now you either know this is right for you or it's not.

**Here's what you're getting:**

- 12 live sessions (6 weeks x 2 per week) with a production AI engineer
- 6 hands-on labs using repositories with 8,500+ automated tests
- Zero-setup dev environment via GitHub Codespaces
- Private Discord community with instructor and TA support
- Certificate of completion, verifiable on LinkedIn
- Lifetime access to recordings, code, and community

**Here's what you're building:**

A portfolio of 5 production-grade AI products that demonstrate you can build, test, and deploy real systems — not just demos. The kind of portfolio that gets you hired for senior AI engineering roles or wins you freelance contracts at $150-$300/hour.

**Here's the math:**

The average AI engineer earns $180K-$250K/year. If this course helps you land one promotion, one role change, or one consulting client, the return is 100x-300x the price of the course.

**Pricing:**
- Beta: $797 (if any beta spots remain)
- Standard: $1,297
- Premium: $1,997 (includes 3 private 1:1 sessions)

**After tomorrow**, enrollment closes and the next cohort won't run for several months. If you've been thinking about it, now is the time.
