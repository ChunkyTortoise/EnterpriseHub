Hey {first_name},

Last email I told you what we're building. Today I want to show you what production AI code actually looks like.

Here's a screenshot of one of the repos you'll work with:

**AgentForge** — Multi-agent orchestration framework
- 1,200+ tests passing in CI
- Tool registry with typed schemas
- Structured output parsing with fallback strategies
- Memory system with configurable backends (Redis, PostgreSQL, in-memory)

Most AI courses hand you a Jupyter notebook. You'll be working with code that has:

```
├── src/agents/         # Agent definitions with dependency injection
├── src/tools/          # Tool registry with schema validation
├── src/memory/         # Pluggable memory backends
├── src/parsing/        # Multi-strategy output parsing
├── tests/              # 1,200+ tests (unit, integration, e2e)
├── docker-compose.yml  # One-command local environment
├── .github/workflows/  # CI/CD with quality gates
└── pyproject.toml      # Modern Python packaging
```

**Why does this matter?**

Because when you go to build your own AI system — or when your company asks you to build one — you won't be starting from a demo. You'll know what production structure looks like because you've worked inside it.

Here are real metrics from the systems you'll study:

| Metric | Value | System |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Automated tests | 8,500+ | All 11 repos |
| Cache hit rate | 89% | EnterpriseHub orchestrator |
| Dispatches/sec | 4.3M | Agent mesh coordinator |
| Response latency | < 200ms | Claude orchestration overhead |
| Pipeline value | $50M+ | Real estate CRM integration |

**These aren't benchmarks from a paper. They're production numbers from systems running in the real world.**

In the next email, I'll share a free sample lesson so you can experience the teaching style firsthand.

P.S. — The course uses GitHub Codespaces, so you won't spend a single minute on environment setup. Open the lab, and you're coding in under 60 seconds.
