Hey {first_name},

You just joined the waitlist for **Production AI Systems: Build & Ship 5 SaaS Products**, and I want to tell you exactly what you're getting into.

Here's the problem I kept running into: every AI tutorial teaches you to build a demo. A chatbot that works on localhost. A RAG system that queries 3 PDFs. A "multi-agent system" that's really just two API calls in a loop.

Then you try to ship it. And everything breaks.

Caching? Not covered. Rate limiting? Figure it out. Error handling when the LLM returns garbage JSON? Good luck. Testing? "Left as an exercise."

I built 11 production repositories with 8,500+ automated tests to solve these exact problems. Systems that manage a $50M+ real estate pipeline, achieve 89% cost reduction through intelligent caching, and handle 4.3M dispatches per second.

**This course teaches you how I built them.**

Over 6 weeks, you'll build 5 working AI products:

1. **Multi-Agent System** — Tool-using agents with memory and structured output (AgentForge)
2. **Document Q&A Engine** — RAG with hybrid BM25 + vector search (DocQA)
3. **MCP Servers** — Custom tool integration via Model Context Protocol
4. **AI Orchestration Platform** — Production hardening with caching and CRM integration (EnterpriseHub)
5. **BI Dashboard** — Observability, anomaly detection, and business intelligence (Insight Engine)

Every lab uses real production code. Not toy examples. Not starter templates. The actual repositories with CI/CD, Docker, monitoring, and thousands of tests.

**Enrollment opens in a few weeks.** Beta pricing ($797, vs $1,297 standard) is limited to the first 20 students.

I'll send you a preview of the course content before enrollment opens so you can see exactly what you're getting.

Talk soon,
Cave

P.S. — If you have questions about whether this course is right for you, just reply to this email. I read every response.
