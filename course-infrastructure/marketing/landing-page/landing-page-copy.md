## Problem Section

### Header
**The gap between "AI demo" and "AI product" is enormous.**

### Body

You've built the chatbot. You've followed the RAG tutorial. You've even wired up an agent that calls a few tools.

Then your manager asks: "Can we ship this?"

And you realize:

- **No caching.** Every request hits the LLM. Your costs are 10x what they should be.
- **No error handling.** When the model returns malformed JSON, your whole pipeline crashes.
- **No testing.** You have zero tests because "how do you even test AI?"
- **No observability.** Something broke in production. You have no idea what.
- **No rate limiting.** Your CRM integration just hammered the API and you're now rate-limited for an hour.

This is where 90% of AI projects die. Not because the model wasn't good enough — because the engineering wasn't production-grade.

## Solution Section

### Header
**Build 5 real AI products in 6 weeks. Ship them to production.**

### Body

Production AI Systems is a live cohort course where you work with real production repositories — not toy examples — to build, test, and deploy 5 complete AI products.

Every lab uses code from repositories with thousands of automated tests, CI/CD pipelines, Docker configurations, and production monitoring. You learn the patterns by working inside systems that already use them.

**What you'll build:**

| Week | Product | What You'll Learn |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Multi-Agent System** | Agent architecture, tool use, memory, structured output |
| 2 | **Document Q&A Engine** | RAG pipeline, embeddings, hybrid search, evaluation |
| 3 | **MCP Servers** | Model Context Protocol, server framework, custom tools |
| 4 | **AI Orchestration Platform** | Caching, rate limiting, error handling, CRM integration |
| 5 | **BI Dashboard** | Observability, anomaly detection, KPI tracking |
| 6 | **Your Deployed Product** | Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, Stripe billing |

## How It Works

### 1. Live Sessions (Tuesdays + Thursdays)
90-minute sessions twice per week. Concept deep-dives, live coding walkthroughs, and Q&A. All sessions recorded.

### 2. Hands-On Labs
Weekly lab assignments using real production code. Open your browser, launch a Codespace, and start building. Zero local setup required.

### 3. Community Support
Private Discord with instructor and TA access. Get unstuck fast. Share your work. Learn from your peers.

### 4. Ship to Production
Week 6, you deploy your own project with CI/CD, monitoring, and Stripe billing. You leave with a live, deployed product.

## Instructor Bio

### Header
**Built by an engineer who ships production AI systems.**

### Body

Cave is a production AI engineer who has built and maintained 11 open-source repositories with over 8,500 automated tests. His systems manage a $50M+ real estate pipeline, achieving 89% cost reduction through intelligent caching and handling 4.3M dispatches per second.

**Credibility markers:**
- 8,500+ automated tests across 11 production repositories
- $50M+ pipeline managed with AI orchestration systems
- 89% cost reduction through L1/L2/L3 intelligent caching
- 4.3M dispatches/sec throughput on production agent mesh
- Open-source contributor with real deployment track records
- Systems running in production serving real users and real revenue

This isn't theoretical knowledge from reading papers. Every concept in this course comes from building and operating real AI systems under real constraints.

## Curriculum Overview

### Header
**6 weeks. 5 products. Production-grade.**

**Week 1: Agent Architecture (AgentForge)**
Build a multi-tool agent with structured output parsing, pluggable memory backends, and dependency injection. Your agent handles tool failures gracefully and produces typed responses.

**Week 2: RAG Systems (DocQA)**
Implement a document Q&A engine with hybrid BM25 + vector search, chunk optimization, and retrieval evaluation. Your system answers questions accurately across thousands of documents.

**Week 3: MCP + Tool Integration (MCP Server Toolkit)**
Build 2 custom MCP servers that expose external tools to AI agents via the Model Context Protocol. Your servers handle authentication, rate limiting, and error propagation.

**Week 4: Production Hardening (EnterpriseHub)**
Add L1/L2/L3 caching, rate-aware API clients, multi-strategy output parsing, and CRM integration to a production orchestration platform. Your system handles 89% of requests from cache.

**Week 5: Observability + Testing (Insight Engine)**
Instrument your AI system with structured logging, latency histograms, and anomaly detection. Build a Streamlit dashboard for real-time monitoring. Write 50+ tests.

**Week 6: Deployment + Operations (Your Project)**
Deploy your project with Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD, health checks, Stripe billing, and production monitoring. Your product is live and accepting users.

## FAQ

### Who is this course for?
Mid-to-senior software engineers (2+ years experience) who want to build production-grade AI systems. You should be comfortable with Python, REST APIs, and basic SQL. This is NOT a beginner programming course or a prompt engineering course.

### What if I can't make the live sessions?
All sessions are recorded and posted within 24 hours. Labs are asynchronous. The Discord community is always available for questions. However, live attendance is strongly recommended for the interactive coding and Q&A portions.

### What do I need installed on my machine?
A web browser. Every lab runs in GitHub Codespaces, a cloud development environment that comes pre-configured with Python 3.11, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, and all dependencies. Click a button and start coding.

### How much time should I budget per week?
5-7 hours per week: 3 hours of live sessions + 2-4 hours on the weekly lab. More experienced engineers may finish labs faster. Those who want to go deeper can explore the full production repos.

### Are the repositories open-source?
Yes, the underlying repos are open-source. The course adds structured curriculum, guided labs with starter code, expert instruction, community support, and certification on top of the open-source code. The value is in knowing which patterns to apply, how they fit together, and why they work — not just having access to the code.

### What happens after the course?
You keep lifetime access to recordings, lab repos, and materials. You join the alumni Discord for ongoing networking. The 5 products you build are yours to deploy, add to your portfolio, or build a business on.

### Can my company pay for this?
Yes. We offer corporate rates for teams of 5-10 at $5,000-$15,000 with custom scheduling. Email cave@productionai.dev for details.

### What's the refund policy?
Full refund within 7 days of course start if you've attended fewer than 2 sessions. After that, no refunds — but you keep access to all materials.

### When does the course start?
Cohort 1 launches in Q2 2026. Join the waitlist for exact dates and early access to enrollment.

### How is this different from other AI courses?
Three things: (1) You work with real production code that has 8,500+ tests, not toy examples. (2) Every repo has CI/CD, Docker, and monitoring already configured — you learn patterns by working inside them. (3) The instructor has managed a $50M+ pipeline with these exact systems. This isn't theoretical.
