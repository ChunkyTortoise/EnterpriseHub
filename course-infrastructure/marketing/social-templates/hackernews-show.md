## Title

Show HN: Production AI Systems — 6-week cohort course using repos with 8,500+ tests

## Post Body

Hi HN,

I've been building production AI systems for the past two years — 11 repositories, 8,500+ automated tests, systems managing a $50M+ pipeline. I'm turning that experience into a 6-week live cohort course.

**The problem**: Every AI tutorial teaches demos. Build a chatbot. Make a RAG system that queries 3 PDFs. Wire up an agent. But production AI engineering — caching, error handling, testing non-deterministic systems, observability, deployment — is barely covered anywhere.

**The course**: Students build 5 production-grade AI products in 6 weeks using the actual repositories:

1. Multi-agent system with tool use and memory (AgentForge, 1,200+ tests)
2. RAG pipeline with hybrid BM25 + vector search (DocQA)
3. Custom MCP servers for tool integration (Model Context Protocol)
4. Production AI orchestration with L1/L2/L3 caching — 89% cache hit rate (EnterpriseHub, 2,000+ tests)
5. BI dashboard with anomaly detection and observability (Insight Engine)

**Technical details**:
- Labs run in GitHub Codespaces (Python 3.11, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis, Docker)
- Zero local setup — click a button and start coding
- Uses FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Streamlit, Claude/Gemini APIs
- Every repo has CI/CD with quality gates
- GitHub Classroom for lab distribution and autograding

**Format**: Live on Maven, 2 sessions/week (90 min each), Tuesday + Thursday evenings PT. All sessions recorded. Private Discord community.

**Pricing**: Beta (Cohort 1): $797, Standard: $1,297, Premium: $1,997 (includes 1:1 sessions). 30 seats max.

The repos are open-source if you want to explore them independently. The course adds structured curriculum, guided labs, live instruction, community, and certification.

Happy to answer questions about the curriculum, the architecture decisions in the repos, or production AI engineering in general.

## Anticipated HN Questions and Answers

**Q: Why not just read the repos yourself for free?**
A: You absolutely can. The repos are open-source. The course adds structure (what to learn in what order), guided labs (build specific things with starter code), live instruction (ask questions, get real-time debugging), community (learn from peers), and certification. Some people learn better with structure and accountability.

**Q: Is 6 weeks enough to learn production AI?**
A: No single course makes you an expert. But 6 weeks of building with real production code, guided by someone who's shipped these systems, gets you further than 6 months of tutorials. You leave with 5 deployed products and patterns you can apply immediately.

**Q: Why Maven and not self-hosted?**
A: For Cohort 1, Maven handles payments, scheduling, and discovery. Lower overhead means I can focus on content quality. If it scales past Cohort 3, I'll move to Circle or self-hosted for lower platform fees.

**Q: $797 seems expensive for a course.**
A: Comparable cohort courses on Maven range from $800-$2,500 (Vibe Coding: $799, AI Product Leader: $2,500). $797 is the beta price — standard is $1,297. The ROI: one AI engineering role change or freelance client pays for the course 100x over.

**Q: What's the refund policy?**
A: Full refund within 7 days of course start if you've attended fewer than 2 sessions.
